You must be familiar with this message ü§¨:
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.00 MiB (GPU 0; 7.93 GiB total capacity; 6.00 GiB already allocated; 14.88 MiB free; 6.00 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch)
While it&#39;s easy to see that GPU memory is full, understanding why and how to fix it can be more challenging. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll go step by step on how to visualize and understand GPU memory usage in PyTorch during training. We‚Äôll also see how to estimate memory requirements and optimize GPU memory usage.
üîé The PyTorch visualizer
PyTorch provides a handy tool for visualizing GPU memory usage:
import torch
from torch import nn
# Start recording memory snapshot history
torch.cuda.memory._record_memory_history(max_entries=100000)
model = nn.Linear(10_000, 50_000, device =&quot;cuda&quot;)
for _ in range(3):
inputs = torch.randn(5_000, 10_000, device=&quot;cuda&quot;)
outputs = model(inputs)
# Dump memory snapshot history to a file and stop recording
torch.cuda.memory._dump_snapshot(&quot;profile.pkl&quot;)
torch.cuda.memory._record_memory_history(enabled=None)
Running this code generates a profile.pkl
file that contains a history of GPU memory usage during execution. You can visualize this history at: https://pytorch.org/memory_viz.
By dragging and dropping your profile.pkl
file, you will see a graph like this:
Let&#39;s break down this graph into key parts:
Model Creation: Memory increases by 2 GB, corresponding to the model&#39;s size:
This memory (in blue) persists throughout execution.
Input Tensor Creation (1st Loop): Memory increases by 200 MB matching the input tensor size:
Forward Pass (1st Loop): Memory increases by 1 GB for the output tensor:
Input Tensor Creation (2nd Loop): Memory increases by 200 MB for a new input tensor. At this point, you might expect the input tensor from step 2 to be freed. Still, it isn&#39;t: the model retains its activation, so even if the tensor is no longer assigned to the variable
inputs
, it remains referenced by the model&#39;s forward pass computation. The model retains its activations because these tensors are required for the backpropagation process in neural networks. Try withtorch.no_grad()
to see the difference.Forward Pass (2nd Loop): Memory increases by 1 GB for the new output tensor, calculated as in step 3.
Release 1st Loop Activation: After the second loop‚Äôs forward pass, the input tensor from the first loop (step 2) can be freed. The model&#39;s activations, which hold the first input tensor, are overwritten by the second loop&#39;s input. Once the second loop completes, the first tensor is no longer referenced and its memory can be released.
Update
output
: The output tensor from step 3 is reassigned to the variableoutput
. The previous tensor is no longer referenced and is deleted, freeing its memory.Input Tensor Creation (3rd Loop): Same as step 4.
Forward Pass (3rd Loop): Same as step 5.
Release 2nd Loop Activation: The input tensor from step 4 is freed.
Update
output
Again: The output tensor from step 5 is reassigned to the variableoutput
, freeing the previous tensor.End of Code Execution: All memory is released.
üìä Visualizing Memory During Training
The previous example was simplified. In real scenarios, we often train complex models rather than a single linear layer. Additionally, the earlier example did not include the training process. Here, we will examine how GPU memory behaves during a complete training loop for a real large language model (LLM).
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
# Start recording memory snapshot history
torch.cuda.memory._record_memory_history(max_entries=100000)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B&quot;).to(&quot;cuda&quot;)
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
for _ in range(3):
inputs = torch.randint(0, 100, (16, 256), device=&quot;cuda&quot;) # Dummy input
loss = torch.mean(model(inputs).logits) # Dummy loss
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
# Dump memory snapshot history to a file and stop recording
torch.cuda.memory._dump_snapshot(&quot;profile.pkl&quot;)
torch.cuda.memory._record_memory_history(enabled=None)
üí° Tip: When profiling, limit the number of steps. Every GPU memory event is recorded, and the file can become very large. For example, the above code generates an 8 MB file.
Here‚Äôs the memory profile for this example:
This graph is more complex than the previous example, but we can still break it down step by step. Notice the three spikes, each corresponding to an iteration of the training loop. Let‚Äôs simplify the graph to make it easier to interpret:
Model Initialization (
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B&quot;).to(&quot;cuda&quot;)
):
The first step involves loading the model onto the GPU. The model parameters (in blue) occupy memory and remain there until the training ends.Forward Pass (
model(inputs)
):
During the forward pass, the activations (intermediate outputs of each layer) are computed and stored in memory for backpropagation. These activations, represented in orange, grow layer by layer until the final layer. The loss is calculated at the peak of the orange zone.Backward Pass (
loss.backward()
):
The gradients (in yellow) are computed and stored during this phase. Simultaneously, the activations are discarded as they are no longer needed, causing the orange zone to shrink. The yellow zone represents memory usage for gradient calculations.Optimizer Step (
optimizer.step()
):
Gradients are used to update the model‚Äôs parameters. Initially, the optimizer itself is initialized (green zone). This initialization is only done once. After that, the optimizer uses the gradients to update the model‚Äôs parameters. To update the parameters, the optimizer temporarily stores intermediate values (red zone). After the update, both the gradients (yellow) and the intermediate optimizer values (red) are discarded, freeing memory.
At this point, one training iteration is complete. The process repeats for the remaining iterations, producing the three memory spikes visible in the graph.
Training profiles like this typically follow a consistent pattern, which makes them useful for estimating GPU memory requirements for a given model and training loop.
üìê Estimating Memory Requirements
From the above section, estimating GPU memory requirements seems simple. The total memory needed should correspond to the highest peak in the memory profile, which occurs during the forward pass. In that case, the memory requirement is (blue + green + orange):
Is it that simple? Actually, there is a trap. The profile can look different depending on the training setup. For example, reducing the batch size from 16 to 2 changes the picture:
- inputs = torch.randint(0, 100, (16, 256), device=&quot;cuda&quot;) # Dummy input
+ inputs = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 256), device=&quot;cuda&quot;) # Dummy input
Now, the highest peaks occur during the optimizer step rather than the forward pass. In this case, the memory requirement becomes (blue + green + yellow + red):
To generalize the memory estimation, we need to account for all possible peaks, regardless of whether they occur during the forward pass or optimizer step.
Now that we have the equation, let&#39;s see how to estimate each component.
Model parameters
The model parameters are the easiest to estimate.
Where:
- is the number of parameters.
- is the precision (in bytes, e.g., 4 for
float32
).
For example, a model with 1.5 billion parameters and a precision of 4 bytes requires:
In the above example, the model size is:
Optimizer State
The memory required for the optimizer state depends on the optimizer type and the model parameters. For instance, the AdamW
optimizer stores two moments (first and second) per parameter. This makes the optimizer state size:
Activations
The memory required for activations is harder to estimate because it includes all the intermediate values computed during the forward pass. To calculate activation memory, we can use a forward hook to measure the size of outputs:
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B&quot;).to(&quot;cuda&quot;)
activation_sizes = []
def forward_hook(module, input, output):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Hook to calculate activation size for each module.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
if isinstance(output, torch.Tensor):
activation_sizes.append(output.numel() * output.element_size())
elif isinstance(output, (tuple, list)):
for tensor in output:
if isinstance(tensor, torch.Tensor):
activation_sizes.append(tensor.numel() * tensor.element_size())
# Register hooks for each submodule
hooks = []
for submodule in model.modules():
hooks.append(submodule.register_forward_hook(forward_hook))
# Perform a forward pass with a dummy input
dummy_input = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.int64, device=&quot;cuda&quot;)
model.eval() # No gradients needed for memory measurement
with torch.no_grad():
model(dummy_input)
# Clean up hooks
for hook in hooks:
hook.remove()
print(sum(activation_sizes)) # Output: 5065216
For the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, this gives 5,065,216 activations per input token. To estimate the total activation memory for an input tensor, use:
Where:
- is the number of activations per token.
- is the batch size.
- is the sequence length.
However, using this method directly isn&#39;t always practical. Ideally, we would like a heuristic to estimate activation memory without running the model. Plus, we can intuitively see that larger models have more activations. This leads to the question: Is there a connection between the number of model parameters and the number of activations?
Not directly, as the number of activations per token depends on the model architecture. However, LLMs tend to have similar structures. By analyzing different models, we observe a rough linear relationship between the number of parameters and the number of activations:
This linear relationship allows us to estimate activations using the heuristic:
Though this is an approximation, it provides a practical way to estimate activation memory without needing to perform complex calculations for each model.
Gradients
Gradients are easier to estimate. The memory required for gradients is the same as the model parameters:
Optimizer Intermediates
When updating the model parameters, the optimizer stores intermediate values. The memory required for these values is the same as the model parameters:
Total Memory
To summarize, the total memory required to train a model is:
with the following components:
- Model Memory:
- Optimizer State:
- Gradients:
- Optimizer Intermediates:
- Activations: , estimated using the heuristic
To make this calculation easier, I created a small tool for you:
üöÄ Next steps
Your initial motivation to understand memory usage was probably driven by the fact that one day, you ran out of memory. Did this blog give you a direct solution to fix that? Probably not. However, now that you have a better understanding of how memory usage works and how to profile it, you&#39;re better equipped to find ways to reduce it.
For a specific list of tips on optimizing memory usage in TRL, you can check the Reducing Memory Usage section of the documentation. These tips, though, are not limited to TRL and can be applied to any PyTorch-based training process.
