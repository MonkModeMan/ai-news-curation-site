Title:CR-BLEA: Contrastive Ranking for Adaptive Resource Allocation in Bilevel Evolutionary Algorithms
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality. Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving -- or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more scalable bilevel optimization.
