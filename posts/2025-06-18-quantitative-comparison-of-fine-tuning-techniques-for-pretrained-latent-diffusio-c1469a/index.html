Title:Quantitative Comparison of Fine-Tuning Techniques for Pretrained Latent Diffusion Models in the Generation of Unseen SAR Image Concepts
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns, while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding learning of the &lt;SAR&gt; token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.
