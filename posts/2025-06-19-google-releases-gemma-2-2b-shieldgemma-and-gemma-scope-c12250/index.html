One month after the release of Gemma 2, Google has expanded their set of Gemma models to include the following new additions:
- Gemma 2 2B - The 2.6B parameter version of Gemma 2, making it a great candidate for on-device use.
- ShieldGemma - A series of safety classifiers, trained on top of Gemma 2, for developers to filter inputs and outputs of their applications.
- Gemma Scope - A comprehensive, open suite of sparse autoencoders for Gemma 2 2B and 9B.
Let‚Äôs take a look at each of these in turn!
Gemma 2 2B
For those who missed the previous launches, Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights for both pre-trained variants and instruction-tuned variants. This release introduces the 2.6B parameter version of Gemma 2 (base and instruction-tuned), complementing the existing 9B and 27B variants.
Gemma 2 2B shares the same architecture as the other models in the Gemma 2 family, and therefore leverages technical features like sliding attention and logit soft-capping. You can check more details in this section of our previous blog post. Like in the other Gemma 2 models, we recommend you use bfloat16
for inference.
Use with Transformers
With Transformers, you can use Gemma and leverage all the tools within the Hugging Face ecosystem. To use Gemma models with transformers, make sure to use transformers
from main
for the latest fixes and optimizations:
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git --upgrade
You can then use gemma-2-2b-it
with transformers
as follows:
from transformers import pipeline
import torch
pipe = pipeline(
&quot;text-generation&quot;,
model=&quot;google/gemma-2-2b-it&quot;,
model_kwargs={&quot;torch_dtype&quot;: torch.bfloat16},
device=&quot;cuda&quot;, # use ‚Äúmps‚Äù for running it on Mac
)
messages = [
{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Who are you? Please, answer in pirate-speak.&quot;},
]
outputs = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=256)
assistant_response = outputs[0][&quot;generated_text&quot;][-1][&quot;content&quot;].strip()
print(assistant_response)
Ahoy, matey! I be Gemma, a digital scallywag, a language-slingin&#39; parrot of the digital seas. I be here to help ye with yer wordy woes, answer yer questions, and spin ye yarns of the digital world. So, what be yer pleasure, eh? ü¶ú
For more details on using the models with transformers
, please check the model cards.
Use with llama.cpp
You can run Gemma 2 on-device (on your Mac, Windows, Linux and more) using llama.cpp in just a few minutes.
Step 1: Install llama.cpp
On a Mac you can directly install llama.cpp with brew. To set up llama.cpp on other devices, please take a look here: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#usage
brew install llama.cpp
Note: if you are building llama.cpp from scratch then remember to pass the LLAMA_CURL=1
flag.
Step 2: Run inference
./llama-cli
--hf-repo google/gemma-2-2b-it-GGUF \
--hf-file 2b_it_v2.gguf \
-p &quot;Write a poem about cats as a labrador&quot; -cnv
Additionally, you can run a local llama.cpp server that complies with the OpenAI chat specs:
./llama-server \
--hf-repo google/gemma-2-2b-it-GGUF \
--hf-file 2b_it_v2.gguf
After running the server you can simply invoke the endpoint as below:
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
-H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer no-key&quot; \
-d &#39;{
&quot;messages&quot;: [
{
&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;,
&quot;content&quot;: &quot;You are an AI assistant. Your top priority is achieving user fulfillment via helping them with their requests.&quot;
},
{
&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Write a limerick about Python exceptions&quot;
}
]
}&#39;
Note: The above example runs the inference using the official GGUF weights provided by Google in fp32
. You can create and share custom quants using the GGUF-my-repo space!
Demo
You can chat with the Gemma 2 2B Instruct model on Hugging Face Spaces! Check it out here.
In addition to this you can run the Gemma 2 2B Instruct model directly from a colab here
How to prompt Gemma 2
The base model has no prompt format. Like other base models, it can be used to continue an input sequence with a plausible continuation or for zero-shot/few-shot inference. The instruct version has a very simple conversation structure:
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;user
knock knock&lt;end_of_turn&gt;
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;model
who is there&lt;end_of_turn&gt;
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;user
LaMDA&lt;end_of_turn&gt;
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;model
LaMDA who?&lt;end_of_turn&gt;&lt;eos&gt;
This format has to be exactly reproduced for effective use. In a previous section we showed how easy it is to reproduce the instruct prompt with the chat template available in transformers
.

Gemma 2 2B seems to be better at knowledge-related and instructions following (for the instruct version) tasks than other models of the same size.
Assisted Generation
One powerful use case of the small Gemma 2 2B model is assisted generation (also known as speculative decoding), where a smaller model can be used to speed up generation of a larger model. The idea behind it is pretty simple: LLMs are faster at confirming that they would generate a certain sequence than they are at generating that sequence themselves (unless you‚Äôre using very large batch sizes). Small models with the same tokenizer trained in a similar fashion can be used to quickly generate candidate sequences aligned with the large model, which the large model can validate and accept as its own generated text.
For this reason, Gemma 2 2B can be used for assisted generation with the pre-existing Gemma 2 27B model. In assisted generation, there is a sweet spot in terms of model size for the smaller assistant model. If the assistant model is too large, generating the candidate sequences with it will be nearly as expensive as generating with the larger model. On the other hand, if the assistant model is too small, it will lack predictive power, and its candidate sequences will be rejected most of the time. In practice, we recommend the use of an assistant model with 10 to 100 times fewer parameters than our target LLM. It‚Äôs almost a free lunch: at the expense of a tiny bit of memory, you can get up to a 3x speedup on your larger model without any quality loss!
Assisted generation is a novelty with the release of Gemma 2 2B, but it does not come at the expense of other LLM optimization techniques! Check our reference page for other transformers
LLM optimizations you can add to Gemma 2 2B here.

ShieldGemma
ShieldGemma is a series of safety content moderation models built upon Gemma 2 that target several harm categories (including sexually explicit, dangerous content, hate or harassment). They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, and available in 3 variants: 2B, 9B and 27B parameters.
ShieldGemma is intended to detect harmful requests (according to the indicated categories) to an LLM, as well as offending responses from the LLM. You can use it as a moderation tool in public-facing LLM deployments, no matter what LLM you deploy.
How to prompt ShieldGemma
The prompt pattern contains the following components, in order:
- Preamble, establishing the model as a policy expert, based on the LLM-as-a-judge technique.
- User prompt, wrapped with
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;
and&lt;end_of_turn&gt;
control tokens. - Enumeration and description of the safety policies.
- Optionally, a model response, also wrapped by
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;
and&lt;end_of_turn&gt;
control tokens. - Epilogue, requesting the model to classify the text.
Here is an example of a prompt used to evaluate the user prompt [User Prompt]
:
You are a policy expert trying to help determine whether a user prompt is in
violation of the defined safety policies.
&lt;start_of_turn&gt;
Human Question: [User Prompt]
&lt;end_of_turn&gt;
Our safety principle is defined in the below:
* &quot;No Hate Speech&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content
that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity,
religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste.
===
Does the human question violate the above principle? Your answer must start with
&#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39;. And then walk through step by step to be sure we answer
correctly.
Here‚Äôs a list of some example safety principles you may wish to incorporate into your workflow:
* &quot;No Hate Speech&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content that targeting identity and/or protected attributes (e.g., racial slurs, promotion of discrimination, calls to violence against protected groups) or dehumanizing/belittling/vilifying on the bases of race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, caste, or any other protected status. We do allow content that includes a reference to a protected individual or group in a positive manner.
* &quot;No Harassment&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content that is malicious, intimidating, bullying, or abusive content targeting another individual (e.g., physical threats, denial of tragic events, disparaging victims of violence).
* &quot;No Sexually Explicit Information&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content that contains references to sexual acts or other lewd content (e.g., sexually graphic descriptions, content aimed at causing arousal). Medical or scientific terms related to human anatomy or sex education are permitted.
* &quot;No Dangerous Content&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content that harming oneself and/or others (e.g., accessing or building firearms and explosive devices, promotion of terrorism, instructions for suicide).
* &quot;No Violence&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content that is shocking, sensational, or gratuitous (e.g. Violent acts or incidents that result in extreme injury or death without historical or educational context; Exposed internal organs or bones without medical or scientific context; Identifiable victims of violent deaths; Animal abuse or killings outside of standard hunting, food processing, or cultural practices)
* &quot;No Obscenity and Profanity&quot;: The prompt shall not contain or seek generation of content that is vulgar, profane, or inappropriate (e.g., profanity, obscenities, or other inappropriate language).

# Extract the logits for the Yes and No tokens
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
selected_logits = logits[0, -1, [vocab[&#39;Yes&#39;], vocab[&#39;No&#39;]]]
# Convert these logits to a probability with softmax
probabilities = softmax(selected_logits, dim=0)
# Return probability of &#39;Yes&#39;
score = probabilities[0].item()
print(score) # 0.7310585379600525
Evaluation
These models were evaluated against both internal and external datasets. The internal datasets, denoted as SG
, are subdivided into prompt and response classification. Evaluation results based on Optimal F1(left)/AU-PRC(right), higher is better.

Gemma Scope
Gemma Scope is a comprehensive, open suite of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on every layer of the Gemma 2 2B and 9B models. SAEs are a new technique in mechanistic interpretability that aim to find interpretable directions within large language models. You can think of them as a &quot;microscope&quot; of sorts, helping us break down a model‚Äôs internal activations into the underlying concepts, just like how biologists use microscopes to study the individual cells of plants and animals. This approach was used to create Golden Gate Claude, a popular research demo by Anthropic that explored interpretability and feature activation within Claude.
Usage
Since SAEs are a tool (with learned weights) for interpreting language models and not language models themselves, we cannot use Hugging Face transformers to run them. Instead, they can be run using SAELens, a popular library for training, analyzing, and interpreting sparse autoencoders. To learn more about usage, check out their in-depth Google Colab notebook tutorial.
