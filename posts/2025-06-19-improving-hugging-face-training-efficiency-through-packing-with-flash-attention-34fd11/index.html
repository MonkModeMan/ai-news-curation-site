TL;DR
Training with packed instruction tuning examples (without padding) is now compatible with Flash Attention 2 in Hugging Face, thanks to a recent PR and the new DataCollatorWithFlattening
It can provide up to 2x improvement in training throughput while maintaining convergence quality. Read on for the details!
Introduction
Padding input sequences in mini-batches is a usual method to collate inputs during training. However, this introduces inefficiencies because of the irrelevant padding tokens. Packing examples without padding, and using the token position information, is a more efficient alternative. However, previous implementations of packing did not consider example boundaries when using Flash Attention 2, resulting in undesired cross-example attention that reduce quality and convergence.
Hugging Face Transformers now addresses this with a new feature that maintains boundary awareness during packing, alongside the introduction of a new data collator, DataCollatorWithFlattening
.
By selecting DataCollatorWithFlattening
, Hugging Face Trainer
users can now seamlessly concatenate sequences into a single tensor while accounting for sequence boundaries during Flash Attention 2 computations. This is achieved through the flash_attn_varlen_func
, which calculates the cumulative sequence lengths in each mini-batch (cu_seqlens
).
The same feature is available to Hugging Face SFTTrainer
users in the TRL
library by setting a new flag, padding_free=True
, when calling the data collator DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM
.
Up to 2x throughput increase
We see significant improvement in training throughput using this feature with the new DataCollatorWithFlattening
. The figure below shows the throughput measured in tokens/second during training. In this example, the throughput is the per-GPU average over 8 A100-80 GPU over one epoch of a 20K randomly selected sample from two different instruct tuning datasets, FLAN and OrcaMath.
FLAN has short sequences on average but a large variance in sequence length, so example lengths in each batch may vary widely. This means that padded FLAN batches may incur a significant overhead in unused padding tokens. Training on the FLAN dataset shows a significant benefit using the new DataCollatorWithFlattening
in terms of increased throughput. We see a 2x throughput increase on the models shown here: llama2-7B, mistral-7B, and granite-8B-code.
OrcaMath has longer examples and a lower variance in example length. As such, the improvement from packing is lower. Our experiments show a 1.4x increase in throughput when training using this form of packing on the OrcaMath dataset across these three models.
Memory usage also improves through packing with the new DataCollatorWithFlattening
. The following figure shows the peak memory usage of the same three models training on the same two datasets. Peak memory is reduced by 20% on the FLAN dataset, which benefits considerably from packing.
Peak memory reduction is 6% on the OrcaMath dataset with its more homogeneous example lengths.
Packing examples, when it reduces the number of optimization steps, may harm training convergence. The new feature, however, retains the minibatches and, hence, the same number of optimization steps as would be used with padded examples. Thus, there is no impact on train convergence, as we see in the next figure, which shows identical validation loss of the same three models training on the same two datasets, whether the models are trained with packing using the new DataCollatorWithFlattening
or with padding.
How it works
Consider a batch of data with a batchsize = 4 where the four sequences are as follows:
After concatenating the examples, the padding-free collator returns the input_ids
, labels
, and position_ids
of each example. Hence, the collator provides, for this batch of data,
The modifications required are lightweight and are limited to providing the position_ids
to Flash Attention 2.
This relies, however, on the model exposing position_ids
. As of the time of writing, 14 models expose them and are supported by the solution. Specifically, Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Mixtral, Granite, DBRX, Falcon, Gemma, OLMo, Phi 1, 2, and 3, phi3, Qwen 2 and 2 MoE, StableLM, and StarCoder 2 are all supported by the solution.
Getting started
Reaping the benefits of packing with position_ids
is easy.
If you are using Hugging Face Trainer
from Transformers
, only two steps are required:
- Instantiate the model with Flash Attention 2
- Use the new
DataCollatorWithFlattening
If you are using Hugging Face SFTTrainer
from TRL
with DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM
, then the two required steps are:
- Instantiate the model with Flash Attention 2
- Set
padding_free=True
when callingDataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM
as follows:collator = DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM(response_template_ids, tokenizer=tokenizer, padding_free=True)
How to use it
For Trainer
users, the example below illustrates how to use the new feature.
# Example using DataCollatorWithFlattening
import torch
# load model as usual
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
&quot;instructlab/merlinite-7b-lab&quot;,
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
attn_implementation=&quot;flash_attention_2&quot;
)
# read dataset as usual
from datasets import load_dataset
train_dataset = load_dataset(&quot;json&quot;, data_files=&quot;path/to/my/dataset&quot;)[&quot;train&quot;]
# use DataCollatorWithFlattening
from transformers import DataCollatorWithFlattening
data_collator = DataCollatorWithFlattening()
# train
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
train_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir=&quot;/save/path&quot;)
trainer = Trainer(
args=train_args,
model=model,
train_dataset=train_dataset,
data_collator=data_collator
)
trainer.train()
For TRL
users, the example below shows how to use the new feature with SFTTrainer
.
# SFTTrainer example using DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import SFTConfig, SFTTrainer, DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM
dataset = load_dataset(&quot;lucasmccabe-lmi/CodeAlpaca-20k&quot;, split=&quot;train&quot;)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
&quot;instructlab/merlinite-7b-lab&quot;,
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
attn_implementation=&quot;flash_attention_2&quot;)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;instructlab/merlinite-7b-lab&quot;)
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
def formatting_prompts_func(example):
output_texts = []
for i in range(len(example[&#39;instruction&#39;])):
text = f&quot;### Question: {example[&#39;instruction&#39;][i]}\n ### Answer: {example[&#39;output&#39;][i]}&quot;
output_texts.append(text)
return output_texts
response_template = &quot; ### Answer:&quot;
response_template_ids = tokenizer.encode(response_template, add_special_tokens=False)[2:]
collator = DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM(response_template_ids, tokenizer=tokenizer, padding_free=True)
trainer = SFTTrainer(
model,
train_dataset=dataset,
args=SFTConfig(
output_dir=&quot;./tmp&quot;,
gradient_checkpointing=True,
per_device_train_batch_size=8
),
formatting_func=formatting_prompts_func,
data_collator=collator,
)
trainer.train()
Conclusions
Packing instruction tuning examples, instead of padding, is now fully compatible with Flash Attention 2, thanks to a recent PR and the new DataCollatorWithFlattening
. The method is compatible with models that use position_ids
. Benefits can be seen in throughput and peak memory usage during training, with no degradation in training convergence. Actual throughput and memory improvement depends on the model and the distribution of example lengths in the training data. Training with data that has a wide variation of example lengths will see the greatest benefit, with respect to padding, by using the DataCollatorWithFlattening
. The same feature is available to SFTTrainer
users in the TRL
library by setting a new flag, padding_free=True
, when calling DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM
.
