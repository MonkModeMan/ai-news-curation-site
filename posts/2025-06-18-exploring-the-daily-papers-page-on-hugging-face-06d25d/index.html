In the fast-paced world of research, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements is crucial. To help developers and researchers keep a pulse on the cutting-edge of AI, Hugging Face introduced the Daily Papers page. Since its launch, Daily Papers has featured high-quality research selected by AK and researchers from the community. Over the past year, more than 3,700 papers have been featured, and the page has grown to over 12k subscribers!
However, many people may not have fully explored all of the features Daily Papers offers. This article will guide you through some hidden functionalities to help you make the most of this platform.
📑 Claim your Papers
On the Daily Papers page, you’ll notice author names listed under the title of each paper. If you&#39;re one of the authors and have a Hugging Face account, you can claim your paper with a single click! After claiming, the paper will be automatically linked to your account, adding visibility to your research and helping build your personal brand in the community.
This feature makes it easy for the community to connect with you and your work, creating more opportunities for collaboration and interaction.
⏫ Submit Papers
The paper submission feature is open to all users who’ve claimed a paper. Users don’t have to limit submissions to their own work, they can also share interesting research papers that would benefit the community.
This allows Hugging Face Papers to maintain an up-to-date and ever-expanding collection of research in the AI field, curated by the community!
💬 Chat with Authors
Under each paper, there is a discussion section where users can leave comments and engage in direct conversations with the authors. Tagging the authors (@username) can lead to real-time feedback, questions or discussion of the research.
This feature fosters interaction, bringing together researchers from the whole community. Everyone, from beginners to experts, can contribute their ideas, making the global AI community even more connected and inclusive.
Whether to ask clarification questions or share constructive feedback, it opens the door to meaningful dialogue and can even spark new ideas or collaborations.
🔗 All You Need in One Page
On each paper’s page, you’ll find related resources, such as models, datasets, demos and other useful collections, all linked on the right side.
Authors can easily associate their models or datasets with their paper by simply adding the paper&#39;s arXiv URL to the README.md file of their resources. This feature allows authors to highlight their work and helps users access everything they need in one convenient place.
🗳 Show Your Support with Upvotes
You can support the paper by clicking the upvote button in the top-right corner. This allows the community to recommend the paper and support the author&#39;s work. The upvote feature highlights influential and innovative research, helping more people discover and focus on excellent papers.
For authors, each upvote acts as a recognition of their efforts and can be a source of motivation to continue producing high-quality research.
🙋 Recommend Similar Papers
If you type @librarian-bot in the comment section, the system will automatically suggest related papers. This feature is great for those looking to dive deeper into a topic or explore similar ideas. It’s like having a personal AI-powered research assistant!
🔠 Multilingual Comments and Translation
At Hugging Face, we value diversity, and that extends to language as well. On the Daily Papers page, users can leave comments in any language, and our built-in translation feature will ensure everyone can understand and contribute.
