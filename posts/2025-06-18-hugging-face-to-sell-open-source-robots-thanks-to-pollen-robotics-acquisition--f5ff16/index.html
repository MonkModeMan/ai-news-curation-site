Since Hugging Face started the LeRobot library in 2024, led by ex-Tesla lead Remi Cadene, the Hugging Face Hub has quickly become the most widely used hub and software platform for open robotics with models, datasets, spaces and libraries.
Today, we‚Äôre excited to take it a step further by welcoming Pollen Robotics to Hugging Face, a team that&#39;s spent the last 9 years building open-source robots and hardware.
We believe robotics could be the next frontier unlocked by AI ‚Äî and it should be open, affordable, and private. Our vision: a future where everyone in the community, from hobbyists to enterprises, can build or use robot assistants or games, starting from open solutions instead of closed, remote controlled, hardware.
‚Äî Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief scientist at Hugging Face
From the start, we built Pollen Robotics with open source at its core, driven by our belief that robots will play a profound role in our lives ‚Äî serving as the interface between AI and the physical world. Hugging Face is a natural home for us to grow, as we share a common goal: putting AI and robotics in the hands of everyone.
‚Äî Matthieu Lapeyre, Pollen co-founder
This marks the fifth acquisition for Hugging Face, after notable additions like Gradio and XetHub.
According to Clem&#39;s 2025 prediction about robots, &quot;at least 100k personal robots will be pre-ordered&quot; this year, signaling massive growth in the space.
This month also celebrates one year since Hugging Face created LeRobot. The community of LeRobot-native DIY robot builders has flourished on YouTube and Discord, truly democratizing access to robotics technology. In just twelve months, the GitHub repository has grown from zero to over 12,000 stars, with dramatic growth continuing into 2025.
The first robot we‚Äôre offering is Reachy 2 ‚Äî your friendly little lab partner for the AI era that is already in use in labs like Cornell or Carnegie Mellon. It‚Äôs a state-of-the-art humanoid robot that is open-source &amp; VR-compatible, built for research, education, and embodied AI experiments. You can already order one for $70,000 by emailing sales@pollen-robotics.com.
Hugging Face‚Äôs Robotics Venture Timeline
2024
- March: Remi Cadene, ex-scientist on Tesla‚Äôs Optimus, joins Hugging Face to lead new open-source robotics project.
- May: Remi &amp; HF Robotics team announce LeRobot open source robotics code library. Becomes largest and most comprehensive open-source library for robotics, with over 12k stars on GH and over 100 repositories on the HF Hub.
- June: Hugging Face and Pollen Robotics collaborate on Reachy 2, the first open-source robot powered by LeRobot
- August: Robotics team releases in-depth tutorial for developers to build and train their own AI-powered robots at low cost
- October: LeRobot partnered with @therobotstudio to release the SO-100 arm ‚Äî a high-performance robotic arm for around $100. It‚Äôs the most accessible option out there, and one of the easiest DIY builds you can do at home!
