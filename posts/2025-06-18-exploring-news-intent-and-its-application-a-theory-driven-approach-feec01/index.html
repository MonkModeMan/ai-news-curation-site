Title:Exploring news intent and its application: A theory-driven approach
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Understanding the intent behind information is crucial. However, news as a medium of public discourse still lacks a structured investigation of perceived news intent and its application. To advance this field, this paper reviews interdisciplinary studies on intentional action and introduces a conceptual deconstruction-based news intent understanding framework (NINT). This framework identifies the components of intent, facilitating a structured representation of news intent and its applications. Building upon NINT, we contribute a new intent perception dataset. Moreover, we investigate the potential of intent assistance on news-related tasks, such as significant improvement (+2.2% macF1) in the task of fake news detection. We hope that our findings will provide valuable insights into action-based intent cognition and computational social science.
