Title:Unsupervised Document and Template Clustering using Multimodal Embeddings
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models, including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues for future research to understand and organize document collections.
