Title:SAE-V: Interpreting Multimodal Models for Enhanced Alignment
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:With the integration of image modality, the semantic space of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is more complex than text-only models, making their interpretability more challenging and their alignment less stable, particularly susceptible to low-quality data, which can lead to inconsistencies between modalities, hallucinations, and biased outputs. As a result, developing interpretability methods for MLLMs is crucial for improving alignment quality and efficiency. In text-only LLMs, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have gained attention for their ability to interpret latent representations. However, extending SAEs to multimodal settings presents new challenges due to modality fusion and the difficulty of isolating cross-modal representations. To address these challenges, we introduce SAE-V, a mechanistic interpretability framework that extends the SAE paradigm to MLLMs. By identifying and analyzing interpretable features along with their corresponding data, SAE-V enables fine-grained interpretation of both model behavior and data quality, facilitating a deeper understanding of cross-modal interactions and alignment dynamics. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal feature weighting, SAE-V provides an intrinsic data filtering mechanism to enhance model alignment without requiring additional models. Specifically, when applied to the alignment process of MLLMs, SAE-V-based data filtering methods could achieve more than 110% performance with less than 50% data. Our results highlight SAE-V&#39;s ability to enhance interpretability and alignment in MLLMs, providing insights into their internal mechanisms.
