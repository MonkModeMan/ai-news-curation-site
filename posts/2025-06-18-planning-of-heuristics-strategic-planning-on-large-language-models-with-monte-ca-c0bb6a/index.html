Title:Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Heuristics have achieved great success in solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Given the fact that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content, and a knowledge base that covers various domains, which offer a novel way to automatically optimize heuristics. Therefore, we propose Planning of Heuristics (PoH), an optimization method that integrates the self-reflection of LLMs with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics (states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions (actions) and evaluation results (rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). The experimental results show that PoH outperforms other hand-crafted heuristics and Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) by other LLMs-based methods, and achieves the significant improvements and the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve COPs.
