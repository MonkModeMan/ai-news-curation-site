Title:Aptly: Making Mobile Apps from Natural Language
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper introduces Aptly, a platform designed to democratize mobile app development, particularly for young learners. Aptly integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with App Inventor, enabling users to create apps using their natural language. User&#39;s description is translated into a programming language that corresponds with App Inventor&#39;s visual blocks. A preliminary study with high school students demonstrated the usability and potential of the platform. Prior programming experience influenced how users interact with Aptly. Participants identified areas for improvement and expressed a shift in perspective regarding programming accessibility and AI&#39;s role in creative endeavors.
