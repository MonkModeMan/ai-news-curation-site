AI is accelerating solutions that can help solve complex societal challenges and drive widespread growth across industries, including medicine, business, education and more. However, only one in five nonprofits report that at least half their organization uses AI ‚Äî and this is despite nearly nine out of 10 reporting a positive productivity gain when using AI apps and features 1 . Today Google for Nonprofits is launching three new updates to help nonprofits build AI capacity to continue to serve their communities.
1. Google for Nonprofits will expand to 100+ new countries and territories
With seven out of 10 nonprofits agreeing that AI apps and features* have increased the quality of their work, this expansion will enable nonprofits in many more places to benefit from our AI tools free of charge or with discounts of more than 70%. Sign up for the Google for Nonprofits newsletter to stay up to date on geographic availability.
2. 10+ new AI features come to Workspace for Nonprofits
With Workspace for Nonprofits, organizations can help up to 2,000 employees or volunteers do their best work every day at no-cost across Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet, NotebookLM and Gemini app.
Now, more than 10 additional features are included with enterprise security and data protections through the no-cost Workspace for Nonprofits plan. These include NotebookLM‚Äôs Audio Overviews ‚Äî lively deep dive discussions between two AI hosts who can summarize key topics from your sources in more than 50 languages ‚Äî and Gemini‚Äôs Deep Research, which helps save hours by browsing the web, analyzing information and developing comprehensive research reports in real-time. Nonprofits can also access more advanced features at steep discounts, costing up to eight times less than other industry offerings for similar AI features.
These launches build on the foundational enterprise-grade data protections for all nonprofits using the $0/user Workspace for Nonprofits offering in the Gemini app and NotebookLM. In the first three months, we&#39;ve seen 180% more nonprofit staff use the Gemini app, and organizations like Infoxchange are using NotebookLM to save the organization a week‚Äôs worth of time, per project, on content programming.
3. Ad Grants can now run on eligible Google Maps&#39; placements
For more than 20 years, Ad Grants has driven more than 14 billion visits to nonprofits‚Äô websites from no-cost Search ads. With new AI-powered features, like Performance Max Ad Grants campaigns, organizations are able to increase their reach to even more people. Now, we&#39;re expanding Ad Grants to run on eligible Google Maps placements in Performance Max campaigns free of charge. Ads can appear beside, above or below search results on Google Maps, including the Maps app, allowing nonprofits to engage people at a local level.
Since its inception, Google.org has provided more than $18 billion in donated products to nonprofits. Google.org and Google employees have also provided nearly $6 billion in cash funding, donations to nonprofits and cutting-edge research support all around the globe. With today&#39;s updates, we‚Äôre further deepening our commitment to nonprofit organizations by ensuring that vital tools and resources are accessible to accelerate missions and drive positive impact for communities worldwide.
