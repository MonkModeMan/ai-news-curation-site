Empowering YouTube creators with generative AI
New video generation technology in YouTube Shorts will help millions of people realize their creative vision
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for generating creative content are improving rapidly, but seamless ways of using them still aren‚Äôt widely available.
We‚Äôre changing that, and making these incredible technologies more easily accessible to millions of creators and billions of users around the world. Over the next few months, we‚Äôre bringing our advanced generative AI models, Veo and Imagen 3, to YouTube creators through Dream Screen.
From our groundbreaking Transformer architecture to years of research in diffusion models, these models are built on nearly a decade of innovation at Google and are now optimized for wide-scale use.
Throughout this journey, we‚Äôve worked closely with artists and creators and have been guided by their curiosity and feedback to ensure our technologies help more people realize their creative vision.
Creators can soon generate video with Dream Screen
By integrating Veo into Dream Screen, YouTube creators will soon be able to generate exciting backgrounds for their Shorts. Early next year, we‚Äôre also making it possible to generate 6 second standalone video clips.
Starting with an initial text prompt, Dream Screen uses Imagen 3 to generate four different images. Creators can pick an image in their preferred style, composition or aesthetic from these options. With the selected image, Veo generates a high-quality 6 second background video, tailored to the user‚Äôs creative vision.
In 2025, creators will also be able to use Dream Screen for generating 6 second standalone video clips for their Shorts, like a cinematic underwater reveal of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Enhancing creativity for everyone
We hope these new video and music generation technologies will inspire more people to bring their ideas to life in vivid, transformative ways.
To help identify AI-generated content, these creations will be watermarked using SynthID, and YouTube will apply a label that clearly communicates to viewers that it was generated with AI.
We‚Äôre continuing to improve our generative AI models and look forward to helping build technologies that unlock creativity for everyone, everywhere. </article> <!-- ‚úÖ Êàª„Çã„Éú„Çø„É≥ --> <div class="mt-10 text-center"> <a id="backLink" href="#" class="inline-block px-4 py-2 border border-sky-600 text-sky-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-100 transition">
