For years, we‚Äôve been investing deeply in AI as the single best way to improve Search and all of our products. We‚Äôre excited by the progress, for example with our Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which you can try in Search Labs. AI is also now central to two businesses that have grown rapidly in recent years: our Cloud and Workspace services and our popular subscription service Google One, which is just about to cross 100 million subscribers.
A new state of the art
In December, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the start of the Gemini era, setting a new state of the art across a wide range of text, image, audio, and video benchmarks. However, Gemini is evolving to be more than just the models. It supports an entire ecosystem ‚Äî from the products that billions of people use every day, to the APIs and platforms helping developers and businesses innovate.
The largest model Ultra 1.0 is the first to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects ‚Äî including math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics ‚Äî to test knowledge and problem-solving abilities.
Today we‚Äôre taking our next step and bringing Ultra to our products and the world.
Introducing Gemini Advanced
Bard has been the best way for people to directly experience our most capable models. To reflect the advanced tech at its core, Bard will now simply be called Gemini. It‚Äôs available in 40 languages on the web, and is coming to a new Gemini app on Android and on the Google app on iOS.
The version with Ultra will be called Gemini Advanced, a new experience far more capable at reasoning, following instructions, coding, and creative collaboration. For example, it can be a personal tutor, tailored to your learning style. Or it can be a creative partner, helping you plan a content strategy or build a business plan. You can read more in this post.
You can start using Gemini Advanced by subscribing to the new Google One AI Premium plan, which offers the best of Google‚Äôs AI features in a single place. This premium plan builds off the popular Google One service offering expanded storage and exclusive product features.
Bringing Gemini‚Äôs capabilities to more products
Gemini models are also coming to products that people and businesses use every day, including Workspace and Google Cloud:
- Workspace: Already, more than 1 million people are using features like Help me write to enhance their productivity and creativity through Duet AI. Duet AI will become Gemini for Workspace, and soon consumers with the Google One AI Premium plan can use Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet.
- Google Cloud: For Cloud customers, Duet AI will also become Gemini in the coming weeks. Gemini will help companies boost productivity, developers code faster, and organizations to protect themselves from cyber attacks, along with countless other benefits.
More to come
Developers have been fundamental to every major technology shift and will play an equally important role in the Gemini ecosystem. Hundreds of thousands of developers and businesses have already been building with Gemini models. While today is about Gemini Advanced and its new capabilities, next week we&#39;ll share more details on what&#39;s coming for developers and Cloud customers.
These latest updates reflect how we‚Äôre approaching innovation boldly, and advancing and deploying this technology responsibly. And we‚Äôre already well underway training the next iteration of our Gemini models ‚Äî so stay tuned for more! </article> <!-- ‚úÖ Êàª„Çã„Éú„Çø„É≥ --> <div class="mt-10 text-center"> <a id="backLink" href="#" class="inline-block px-4 py-2 border border-sky-600 text-sky-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-100 transition">
