Want to help build the future at -- if we may say so ourselves -- one of the coolest places in AI? Today we‚Äôre announcing our internship program for 2023. Together with your Hugging Face mentor(s), we‚Äôll be working on cutting edge problems in AI and machine learning.
Applicants from all backgrounds are welcome! Ideally, you have some relevant experience and are excited about our mission to democratize responsible machine learning. The progress of our field has the potential to exacerbate existing disparities in ways that disproportionately hurt the most marginalized people in society ‚Äî including people of color, people from working-class backgrounds, women, and LGBTQ+ people. These communities must be centered in the work we do as a research community. So we strongly encourage proposals from people whose personal experience reflects these identities!

The following internship positions are available in the Open Source team, alongside maintainers of the respective libraries:
- Accelerate Internship, to lead the integration of new, impactful features in the library.

The following Science team positions are available:

The following other internship positions are available:
