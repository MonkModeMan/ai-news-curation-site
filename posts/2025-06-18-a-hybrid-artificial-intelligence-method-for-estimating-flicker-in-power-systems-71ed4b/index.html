Title:A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Method for Estimating Flicker in Power Systems
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power distribution this http URL proposed method leverages the robustness of the H filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies embedded in the this http URL synergy enables efficient time domain estimation with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of existing frequency domain this http URL conventional techniques this hybrid AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise characteristics or extensive this http URL validate the method performance we conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world this http URL demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based estimators.
