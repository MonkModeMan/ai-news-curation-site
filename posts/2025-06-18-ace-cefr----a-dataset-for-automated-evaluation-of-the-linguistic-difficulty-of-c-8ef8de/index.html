Title:Ace-CEFR -- A Dataset for Automated Evaluation of the Linguistic Difficulty of Conversational Texts for LLM Applications
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:There is an unmet need to evaluate the language difficulty of short, conversational passages of text, particularly for training and filtering Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce Ace-CEFR, a dataset of English conversational text passages expert-annotated with their corresponding level of text difficulty. We experiment with several models on Ace-CEFR, including Transformer-based models and LLMs. We show that models trained on Ace-CEFR can measure text difficulty more accurately than human experts and have latency appropriate to production environments. Finally, we release the Ace-CEFR dataset to the public for research and development.
