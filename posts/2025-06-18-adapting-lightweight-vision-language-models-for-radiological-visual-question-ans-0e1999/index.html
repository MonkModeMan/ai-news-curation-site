Title:Adapting Lightweight Vision Language Models for Radiological Visual Question Answering
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advancements in vision-language systems have improved the accuracy of Radiological Visual Question Answering (VQA) Models. However, some challenges remain across each stage of model development: limited expert-labeled images hinders data procurement at scale; the intricate and nuanced patterns of radiological images make modeling inherently difficult; and the lack of evaluation evaluation efforts makes it difficult to identify cases where the model might be ill-conditioned. In this study, we fine-tune a lightweight 3B parameter vision-language model for Radiological VQA, demonstrating that small models, when appropriately tuned with curated data, can achieve robust performance across both open- and closed-ended questions. We propose a cost-effective training pipeline from synthetic question-answer pair generation to multi-stage fine-tuning on specialised radiological domain-targeted datasets (e.g., ROCO v2.0, MedPix v2.0). Our results show that despite operating at a fraction of the scale of state-of-the-art models such as LLaVA-Med, our model achieves promising performance given its small parameter size and the limited scale of training data. We introduce a lightweight saliency-based diagnostic tool that enables domain experts to inspect VQA model performance and identify ill-conditioned failure modes through saliency analysis.
