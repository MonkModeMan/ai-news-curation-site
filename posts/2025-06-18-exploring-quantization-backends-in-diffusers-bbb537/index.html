Large diffusion models like Flux (a flow-based text-to-image generation model) can create stunning images, but their size can be a hurdle, demanding significant memory and compute resources. Quantization offers a powerful solution, shrinking these models to make them more accessible without drastically compromising performance. But the big question always is: can you actually tell the difference in the final image?
Before we dive into the technical details of how various quantization backends in Hugging Face Diffusers work, why not test your own perception?
Spot The Quantized Model
We created a setup where you can provide a prompt, and we generate results using both the original, high-precision model (e.g., Flux-dev in BF16) and several quantized versions (BnB 4-bit, BnB 8-bit). The generated images are then presented to you and your challenge is to identify which ones came from the quantized models.
Try it out here or below!
Often, especially with 8-bit quantization, the differences are subtle and may not be noticeable without close inspection. More aggressive quantization like 4-bit or lower might be more noticeable, but the results can still be good, especially considering the massive memory savings. NF4 often gives the best trade-off though.
Now, let&#39;s dive deeper.
Quantization Backends in Diffusers
Building on our previous post, &quot;Memory-efficient Diffusion Transformers with Quanto and Diffusers&quot;, this post explores the diverse quantization backends integrated directly into Hugging Face Diffusers. We&#39;ll examine how bitsandbytes, GGUF, torchao, Quanto and native FP8 support make large and powerful models more accessible, demonstrating their use with Flux.
Before diving into the quantization backends, let&#39;s introduce the FluxPipeline (using the black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev checkpoint) and its components, which we&#39;ll be quantizing. Loading the full FLUX.1-dev
model in BF16 precision requires approximately 31.447 GB of memory. The main components are:
- Text Encoders (CLIP and T5):
- Function: Process input text prompts. FLUX-dev uses CLIP for initial understanding and a larger T5 for nuanced comprehension and better text rendering.
- Memory: T5 - 9.52 GB; CLIP - 246 MB (in BF16)
- Transformer (Main Model - MMDiT):
- Function: Core generative part (Multimodal Diffusion Transformer). Generates images in latent space from text embeddings.
- Memory: 23.8 GB (in BF16)
- Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE):
- Function: Translates images between pixel and latent space. Decodes generated latent representation to a pixel-based image.
- Memory: 168 MB (in BF16)
- Focus of Quantization: Examples will primarily focus on the
transformer
andtext_encoder_2
(T5) for the most substantial memory savings.

bitsandbytes (BnB)
bitsandbytes
is a popular and user-friendly library for 8-bit and 4-bit quantization, widely used for LLMs and QLoRA fine-tuning. We can use it for transformer-based diffusion and flow models, too.

print(f&quot;Pipeline memory usage: {torch.cuda.max_memory_reserved() / 1024**3:.3f} GB&quot;)
image.save(&quot;flux-dev_bnb_4bit.png&quot;)
Note: When using
PipelineQuantizationConfig
withbitsandbytes
, you need to importDiffusersBitsAndBytesConfig
fromdiffusers
andTransformersBitsAndBytesConfig
fromtransformers
separately. This is because these components originate from different libraries. If you prefer a simpler setup without managing these distinct imports, you can use an alternative approach for pipeline-level quantization, an example of this method is in the Diffusers documentation on Pipeline-level quantization.

torchao
torchao
is a PyTorch-native library for architecture optimization, offering quantization, sparsity, and custom data types, designed for compatibility with torch.compile
and FSDP. Diffusers supports a wide range of torchao
&#39;s exotic data types, enabling fine-grained control over model optimization.

FP8 Layerwise Casting (enable_layerwise_casting
)
FP8 Layerwise Casting is a memory optimization technique. It works by storing the model&#39;s weights in the compact FP8 (8-bit floating point) format, which uses roughly half the memory of standard FP16 or BF16 precision. Just before a layer performs its calculations, its weights are dynamically cast up to a higher compute precision (like FP16/BF16). Immediately afterward, the weights are cast back down to FP8 for efficient storage. This approach works because the core computations retain high precision, and layers particularly sensitive to quantization (like normalization) are typically skipped. This technique can also be combined with group offloading for further memory savings.

pipe.to(&quot;cuda&quot;)

Combining with More Memory Optimizations and torch.compile
Most of these quantization backends can be combined with the memory optimization techniques offered in Diffusers. Let&#39;s explore CPU offloading, group offloading, and torch.compile
. You can learn more about these techniques in the Diffusers documentation.
Note: At the time of writing, bnb +
torch.compile
also works if bnb is installed from source and using pytorch nightly or with fullgraph=False.
Example (Flux-dev with BnB 4-bit + enable_model_cpu_offload):
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline
from diffusers import BitsAndBytesConfig as DiffusersBitsAndBytesConfig
from diffusers.quantizers import PipelineQuantizationConfig
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig as TransformersBitsAndBytesConfig
model_id = &quot;black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev&quot;
pipeline_quant_config = PipelineQuantizationConfig(
quant_mapping={
&quot;transformer&quot;: DiffusersBitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True, bnb_4bit_quant_type=&quot;nf4&quot;, bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16),
&quot;text_encoder_2&quot;: TransformersBitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True, bnb_4bit_quant_type=&quot;nf4&quot;, bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16),
}
)
pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
model_id,
quantization_config=pipeline_quant_config,
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)
- pipe.to(&quot;cuda&quot;)
+ pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
Model CPU Offloading (enable_model_cpu_offload
): This method moves entire model components (like the UNet, text encoders, or VAE) between the CPU and GPU during the inference pipeline. It offers substantial VRAM savings and is generally faster than more granular offloading because it involves fewer, larger data transfers.
bnb + enable_model_cpu_offload
:
| Precision | Memory after loading | Peak memory | Inference time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4-bit | 12.383 GB | 12.383 GB | 17 seconds |
| 8-bit | 19.182 GB | 23.428 GB | 27 seconds |
Example (Flux-dev with fp8 layerwise casting + group offloading):
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline, AutoModel
model_id = &quot;black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev&quot;
transformer = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
model_id,
subfolder=&quot;transformer&quot;,
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
# device_map=&quot;cuda&quot;
)
transformer.enable_layerwise_casting(storage_dtype=torch.float8_e4m3fn, compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
+ transformer.enable_group_offload(onload_device=torch.device(&quot;cuda&quot;), offload_device=torch.device(&quot;cpu&quot;), offload_type=&quot;leaf_level&quot;, use_stream=True)
pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, transformer=transformer, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
- pipe.to(&quot;cuda&quot;)
Group offloading (enable_group_offload
for diffusers
components or apply_group_offloading
for generic torch.nn.Module
s): It moves groups of internal model layers (like torch.nn.ModuleList
or torch.nn.Sequential
instances) to the CPU. This approach is typically more memory-efficient than full model offloading and faster than sequential offloading.
FP8 layerwise casting + group offloading:
| precision | Memory after loading | Peak memory | Inference time |
|---|---|---|---|
| FP8 (e4m3) | 9.264 GB | 14.232 GB | 58 seconds |
Example (Flux-dev with torchao 4-bit + torch.compile):
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline
from diffusers import TorchAoConfig as DiffusersTorchAoConfig
from diffusers.quantizers import PipelineQuantizationConfig
from transformers import TorchAoConfig as TransformersTorchAoConfig
from torchao.quantization import Float8WeightOnlyConfig
model_id = &quot;black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev&quot;
dtype = torch.bfloat16
pipeline_quant_config = PipelineQuantizationConfig(
quant_mapping={
&quot;transformer&quot;:DiffusersTorchAoConfig(&quot;int4_weight_only&quot;),
&quot;text_encoder_2&quot;: TransformersTorchAoConfig(&quot;int4_weight_only&quot;),
}
)
pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
model_id,
quantization_config=pipeline_quant_config,
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
device_map=&quot;balanced&quot;
)
+ pipe.transformer = torch.compile(pipe.transformer, mode=&quot;max-autotune&quot;, fullgraph=True)
Note:
torch.compile
can introduce subtle numerical differences, leading to changes in image output
torch.compile: Another complementary approach is to accelerate the execution of your model with PyTorch 2.x’s torch.compile() feature. Compiling the model doesn’t directly lower memory, but it can significantly speed up inference. PyTorch 2.0’s compile (Torch Dynamo) works by tracing and optimizing the model graph ahead-of-time.
torchao + torch.compile
:
| torchao Precision | Memory after loading | Peak memory | Inference time | Compile Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| int4_weight_only | 10.635 GB | 15.238 GB | 6 seconds | ~285 seconds |
| int8_weight_only | 17.020 GB | 22.473 GB | 8 seconds | ~851 seconds |
| float8_weight_only | 17.016 GB | 22.115 GB | 8 seconds | ~545 seconds |
