Title:Uncovering Bias Paths with LLM-guided Causal Discovery: An Active Learning and Dynamic Scoring Approach
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets.
