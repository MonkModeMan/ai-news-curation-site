Florence-2, released by Microsoft in June 2024, is a foundation vision-language model. This model is very attractive because of its small size (0.2B and 0.7B) and strong performance on a variety of computer vision and vision-language tasks.
Florence supports many tasks out of the box: captioning, object detection, OCR, and more. However, your task or domain might not be supported, or you may want to better control the model&#39;s output for your task. That&#39;s when you will need to fine-tune.
In this post, we show an example on fine-tuning Florence on DocVQA. The authors report that Florence 2 can perform visual question answering (VQA), but the released models don&#39;t include VQA capability. Let&#39;s see what we can do!
Pre-training Details and Architecture
Florence-2 Architecture
Regardless of the computer vision task being performed, Florence-2 formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task. Florence-2 takes an image and text as inputs, and generates text as output. The model has a simple structure. It uses a DaViT vision encoder to convert images into visual embeddings, and BERT to convert text prompts into text and location embeddings. The resulting embeddings are then processed by a standard encoder-decoder transformer architecture, generating text and location tokens. Florence-2&#39;s strength doesn&#39;t stem from its architecture, but from the massive dataset it was pre-trained on. The authors noted that leading computer vision datasets typically contain limited information - WIT only includes image/caption pairs, SA-1B only contains images and associated segmentation masks. Therefore, they decided to build a new FLD-5B dataset containing a wide range of information about each image - boxes, masks, captions, and grounding. The dataset creation process was largely automated. The authors used off-the-shelf task-specific models and a set of heuristics and quality checks to clean the obtained results. The result was a new dataset containing over 5 billion annotations for 126 million images, which was used to pre-train the Florence-2 model.
Original performance on VQA
We experimented with various methods to adapt the model for VQA (Visual Question Answering) responses. The most effective approach we found was region-to-description prompting, though it doesn&#39;t fully align with VQA tasks. Captioning provides descriptive information about the image but doesn&#39;t allow for direct question input. We also tested several &quot;unsupported&quot; prompts such as &quot; &lt;VQA&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;vqa&gt;&quot;, and &quot;&lt;Visual question answering&gt;&quot;. Unfortunately, these attempts yielded unusable results.
Performance on DocVQA after fine-tuning
We measure performance using the Levenshtein&#39;s similarity, the standard metric for the DocVQA dataset. Before fine-tuning, the similarity between the model&#39;s predictions and the ground truth on the validation dataset was 0, as the outputs were not close to the ground truth. After fine-tuning with the training set for seven epochs, the similarity score on the validation set improved to 57.0. We created a 🤗 space to demo the fine-tuned model. While the model performs well for DocVQA, there is room for improvement in general document understanding. However, it successfully completes the tasks, showcasing Florence-2&#39;s potential for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. To develop an exceptional VQA model, we recommend further fine-tuning Florence-2 usingThe Cauldron. We have already provided the necessary code on our GitHub page.
To give a solid example, below we provide two inference results before and after fine-tuning. You can also try the model here.
Before and After Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning Details
For pre-training, the authors used a batch size of 2048 for the base model and 3072 for the large one. They also describe a performance improvement when fine-tuning with an unfrozen image encoder, compared with freezing it.
We conducted our experiments with a much lower resource setup, to explore what the model would be capable of in more constrained fine-tuning environments. We froze the vision encoder and used a batch size of 6 on a single A100 GPU in Colab, or a batch size of 1 with a T4. In parallel, we conducted an experiment with more resources, fine-tuning the entire model with a batch size of 64. This training process took 70 minutes on a cluster equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. This trained model can be found here.
In every case, we found a small learning rate of 1e-6 to be beneficial for training. With larger learning rates the model will quickly overfit the training set.
Code Walkthrough
If you want to follow along, you can find our Colab fine-tuning notebook here checkpoint on the DocVQA dataset. Let&#39;s start by installing the dependencies.
!pip install -q datasets flash_attn timm einops
Load the DocVQA dataset from the Hugging Face Hub.
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
data = load_dataset(&quot;HuggingFaceM4/DocumentVQA&quot;)
We can load the model and processor using the AutoModelForCausalLM
and AutoProcessor
classes from the transformers library. We need to pass trust_remote_code=True
because the model uses custom code – it has not been natively integrated into transformers yet. We will also freeze the vision encoder to make fine-tuning less expensive.
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor
import torch
device = torch.device(&quot;cuda&quot; if torch.cuda.is_available() else &quot;cpu&quot;)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
&quot;microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft&quot;,
trust_remote_code=True,
revision=&#39;refs/pr/6&#39;
).to(device)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft&quot;,
trust_remote_code=True, revision=&#39;refs/pr/6&#39;)
for param in model.vision_tower.parameters():
param.is_trainable = False
Let&#39;s now fine-tune the model! We&#39;ll build a training PyTorch Dataset in which we&#39;ll prepend a &lt;DocVQA&gt; prefix to each question from the dataset.
import torch from torch.utils.data import Dataset
class DocVQADataset(Dataset):
def __init__(self, data):
self.data = data
def __len__(self):
return len(self.data)
def __getitem__(self, idx):
example = self.data[idx]
question = &quot;&lt;DocVQA&gt;&quot; + example[&#39;question&#39;]
first_answer = example[&#39;answers&#39;][0]
image = example[&#39;image&#39;].convert(&quot;RGB&quot;)
return question, first_answer, image
We&#39;ll now build the data collator that builds training batches from the dataset samples, and start training. In A100 with 40GB memory, we can fit in 6 examples. If you&#39;re training on T4, you can use a batch size of 1.
import os
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from tqdm import tqdm
from transformers import AdamW, get_scheduler
def collate_fn(batch):
questions, answers, images = zip(*batch)
inputs = processor(text=list(questions), images=list(images), return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;, padding=True).to(device)
return inputs, answers
train_dataset = DocVQADataset(data[&#39;train&#39;])
val_dataset = DocVQADataset(data[&#39;validation&#39;])
batch_size = 6
num_workers = 0
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size,
collate_fn=collate_fn, num_workers=num_workers, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size,
collate_fn=collate_fn, num_workers=num_workers)
We can train the model now.
epochs = 7
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-6)
num_training_steps = epochs * len(train_loader)
lr_scheduler = get_scheduler(name=&quot;linear&quot;, optimizer=optimizer,
num_warmup_steps=0, num_training_steps=num_training_steps,)
for epoch in range(epochs):
model.train()
train_loss = 0
i = -1
for inputs, answers in tqdm(train_loader, desc=f&quot;Training Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}&quot;):
i += 1
input_ids = inputs[&quot;input_ids&quot;]
pixel_values = inputs[&quot;pixel_values&quot;]
labels = processor.tokenizer(text=answers, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;, padding=True, return_token_type_ids=False).input_ids.to(device)
outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, pixel_values=pixel_values, labels=labels)
loss = outputs.loss
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
lr_scheduler.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
train_loss += loss.item()
avg_train_loss = train_loss / len(train_loader)
print(f&quot;Average Training Loss: {avg_train_loss}&quot;)
model.eval()
val_loss = 0
with torch.no_grad():
for batch in tqdm(val_loader, desc=f&quot;Validation Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}&quot;):
inputs, answers = batch
input_ids = inputs[&quot;input_ids&quot;]
pixel_values = inputs[&quot;pixel_values&quot;]
labels = processor.tokenizer(text=answers, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;, padding=True, return_token_type_ids=False).input_ids.to(device)
outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, pixel_values=pixel_values, labels=labels)
loss = outputs.loss
val_loss += loss.item()
print(val_loss / len(val_loader))
You can save the model and processor by calling save_pretrained()
on both objects. The fully fine-tuned model is here and the demo is here.
Conclusions
In this post, we showed that Florence-2 can be effectively fine-tuned to a custom dataset, achieving impressive performance on a completely new task in a short amount of time. This capability is particularly valuable for those looking to deploy this small model on devices or use it cost-effectively in production environments. We encourage the open-source community to leverage this fine-tuning tutorial and explore the remarkable potential of Florence-2 for a wide range of new tasks! We can&#39;t wait to see your models on the 🤗 Hub!
