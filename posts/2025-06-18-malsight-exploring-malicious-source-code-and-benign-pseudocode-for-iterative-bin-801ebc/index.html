Title:MALSIGHT: Exploring Malicious Source Code and Benign Pseudocode for Iterative Binary Malware Summarization
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection. Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise. However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations,and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries. Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode. Specifically, we construct the first malware summary dataset, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort. At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS and benign pseudocode datasets. Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary. Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting summaries&#39; usability, accuracy, and completeness. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT. Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger Code-Llama.
