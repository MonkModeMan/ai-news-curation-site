We designed Gemini 2.5 to be a family of hybrid reasoning models that provide amazing performance, while also being at the Pareto Frontier of cost and speed. Today, we‚Äôre taking the next step with our 2.5 Pro and Flash models by releasing them as stable and generally available. And we‚Äôre bringing you 2.5 Flash-Lite in preview ‚Äî our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet.
Making 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro generally available
Thanks to all of your feedback, today we‚Äôre releasing stable versions of 2.5 Flash and Pro, so you can build production applications with confidence. Developers like Spline and Rooms and organizations like Snap and SmartBear have already been using the latest versions in-production for the last few weeks.
Introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
We‚Äôre also introducing a preview of the new Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. You can start building with the preview version now, and we‚Äôre looking forward to your feedback.
2.5 Flash Lite has all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks. It excels at high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification, with lower latency than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts. It comes with the same capabilities that make Gemini 2.5 helpful, including the ability to turn thinking on at different budgets, connecting to tools like Google Search and code execution, multimodal input, and a 1 million-token context length.
See more details about our 2.5 family of models in the latest Gemini technical report.
The preview of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, alongside the stable versions of 2.5 Flash and Pro. Both 2.5 Flash and Pro are also accessible in the Gemini app. We‚Äôve also brought custom versions of 2.5 Flash-Lite and Flash to Search.
We can‚Äôt wait to see what you continue to build with Gemini 2.5. </article> <!-- ‚úÖ Êàª„Çã„Éú„Çø„É≥ --> <div class="mt-10 text-center"> <a id="backLink" href="#" class="inline-block px-4 py-2 border border-sky-600 text-sky-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-100 transition">
