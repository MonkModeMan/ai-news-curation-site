Today, Google is announcing the 20 organizations joining the newest Google.org Accelerator: Generative AI cohort. These organizations, which will use generative AI to address significant societal problems including crisis response, antimicrobial resistance and children&#39;s mental health, were selected through an open call for nonprofits, social enterprises, civic entities and universities. Each one will receive a share of $30 million along with six months of technical training, pro bono support from Google‚Äôs AI experts and access to Google Cloud credits.
Google.org launched the Generative AI Accelerator in 2024 to bring the benefits of AI to the social sector by providing nonprofits with funding and technical expertise. The opportunity is clear: in a recent Google.org survey, nearly two-thirds of nonprofits using AI tools reported feeling more confident in serving their organization‚Äôs mission when they use AI apps and features 1 , yet only one in five say that at least half their organization uses generative AI. Now, seven months after graduating, members of our first cohort like Tabiya, a nonprofit addressing global youth unemployment, are seeing the benefits. Tabiya has reached more than 8,000 jobseekers in half the time and at a quarter of the cost thanks to Compass: an open-source conversational agent built using Gemini.
