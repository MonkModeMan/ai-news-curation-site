From July 7th to July 11th, we hosted our first Open Source AI Game Jam, an exciting event that challenged game developers to create innovative games within a tight 48-hour window using AI.
The primary objective was to create games that incorporate at least one Open Source AI Tool. Although proprietary AI tools were allowed, we encouraged participants to integrate open-source tools into their game or workflow.
The response to our initiative was beyond our expectations, with over 1300 signups and the submission of 88 amazing games.
You can try them here 👉 https://itch.io/jam/open-source-ai-game-jam/entries
The Theme: Expanding
To inspire creativity, we decided on the theme of &quot;EXPANDING.&quot; We left it open to interpretation, allowing developers to explore and experiment with their ideas, leading to a diverse range of games.
The games were evaluated by their peers and contributors based on three key criteria: fun, creativity, and adherence to the theme.
The top 10 games were then presented to three judges (Dylan Ebert, Thomas Simonini and Omar Sanseviero), who selected the best game.
The Winner 🏆🥇
After careful deliberation, the judges crowned one outstanding game as the Winner of the Open Source AI Game Jam.
Code: Ruben Gres AI assets: Philippe Saade Music / SFX: Matthieu Deloffre
In this AI-generated game, you visit a museum where the paintings come to life. Snip the objects in the paintings to uncover their hidden secrets.
