Title:J3DAI: A tiny DNN-Based Edge AI Accelerator for 3D-Stacked CMOS Image Sensor
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper presents J3DAI, a tiny deep neural network-based hardware accelerator for a 3-layer 3D-stacked CMOS image sensor featuring an artificial intelligence (AI) chip integrating a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based accelerator. The DNN accelerator is designed to efficiently perform neural network tasks such as image classification and segmentation. This paper focuses on the digital system of J3DAI, highlighting its Performance-Power-Area (PPA) characteristics and showcasing advanced edge AI capabilities on a CMOS image sensor. To support hardware, we utilized the Aidge comprehensive software framework, which enables the programming of both the host processor and the DNN accelerator. Aidge supports post-training quantization, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational complexity, making it crucial for deploying models on resource-constrained hardware like J3DAI. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of this innovative design in the field of edge AI, showcasing its potential to handle both simple and computationally intensive tasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the architecture and exploring new applications to fully leverage the capabilities of J3DAI. As edge AI continues to grow in importance, innovations like J3DAI will play a crucial role in enabling real-time, low-latency, and energy-efficient AI processing at the edge.
