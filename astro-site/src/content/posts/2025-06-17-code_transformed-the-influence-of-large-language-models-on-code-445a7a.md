title: 'code_transformed: The Influence of Large Language Models on Code'
description: "arXiv:2506.12014v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Coding remains one\
  \ of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With\
  \ the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities\
  \ have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts\
  \ a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation\
  \ be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates\
  \ the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity,\
  \ maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories\
  \ linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable\
  \ trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated\
  \ code. For instance, the proportion of snake\\_case variable names in Python code\
  \ increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how\
  \ LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given\
  \ the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult\
  \ or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted\
  \ by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence\
  \ that LLMs affect real-world programming style."

View PDFAbstract:Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices.
