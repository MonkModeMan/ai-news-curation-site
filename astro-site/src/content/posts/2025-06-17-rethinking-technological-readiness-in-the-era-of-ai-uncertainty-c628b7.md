Title:Rethinking Technological Readiness in the Era of AI Uncertainty
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability, safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and risk assessment.
