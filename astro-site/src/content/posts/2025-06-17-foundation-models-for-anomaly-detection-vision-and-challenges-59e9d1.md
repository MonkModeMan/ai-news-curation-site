title: 'Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection: Vision and Challenges'
description: "arXiv:2502.06911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As data\
  \ continues to grow in volume and complexity across domains such as finance, manufacturing,\
  \ and healthcare, effective anomaly detection is essential for identifying irregular\
  \ patterns that may signal critical issues. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have\
  \ emerged as a powerful tool for advancing anomaly detection. They have demonstrated\
  \ unprecedented capabilities in enhancing anomaly identification, generating detailed\
  \ data descriptions, and providing visual explanations. This survey presents the\
  \ first comprehensive review of recent advancements in FM-based anomaly detection.\
  \ We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies FMs into three categories based on\
  \ their roles in anomaly detection tasks, i.e., as encoders, detectors, or interpreters.\
  \ We provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key challenges\
  \ in leveraging FMs for improved anomaly detection. We also outline future research\
  \ directions in this rapidly evolving field."
