title: "Dispositions and Roles of Generically Dependent Entities"
description: "arXiv:2506.17085v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: BFO 2020 does not support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent continuants (like software or datasets). In this paper, we argue that this is a severe limitation, which prevents, for example, the adequate representation of the functions of computer models or the various roles of datasets during the execution of these models. We discuss the aspects of BFO 2020 that prevent the representation of realizable entities of generically dependent continuants. Two approaches to address the issue are presented: (a) the use of defined classes and (b) a proposal of changes that allow BFO to support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent continuants."
