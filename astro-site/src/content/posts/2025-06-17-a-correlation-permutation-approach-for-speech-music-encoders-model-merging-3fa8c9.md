title: A correlation-permutation approach for speech-music encoders model merging
description: "arXiv:2506.11403v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Creating a unified\
  \ speech and music model requires expensive pre-training. Model merging can instead\
  \ create an unified audio model with minimal computational expense. However, direct\
  \ merging is challenging when the models are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated\
  \ by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a correlation-permutation approach that aligns a\
  \ music encoder's internal layers with a speech encoder. We extend previous work\
  \ to the case of merging transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix\
  \ that maximizes the model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling\
  \ effective fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains\
  \ speech capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music performance,\
  \ achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared to linear interpolation\
  \ model merging. This work allows the creation of unified audio models from independently\
  \ trained encoders."
