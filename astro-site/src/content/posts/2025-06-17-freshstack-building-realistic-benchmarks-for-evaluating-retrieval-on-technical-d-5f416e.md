title: 'FreshStack: Building Realistic Benchmarks for Evaluating Retrieval on Technical
  Documents'
description: "arXiv:2504.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce\
  \ FreshStack, a holistic framework for automatically building information retrieval\
  \ (IR) evaluation benchmarks by incorporating challenging questions and answers.\
  \ FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus collection from\
  \ code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from community-asked questions\
  \ and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving documents using a fusion\
  \ of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We use FreshStack to build five\
  \ datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics to ensure the tasks are sufficiently\
  \ challenging. On FreshStack, existing retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box,\
  \ significantly underperform oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty\
  \ of headroom to improve IR quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers\
  \ do not improve first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics) and oracle\
  \ context helps an LLM generator generate a high-quality RAG answer. We hope FreshStack\
  \ will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable, and uncontaminated\
  \ IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks."
