title: 'Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary

Title:Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study
View PDFAbstract:Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities.
