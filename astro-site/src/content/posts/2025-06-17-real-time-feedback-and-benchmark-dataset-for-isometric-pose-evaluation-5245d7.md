title: Real-Time Feedback and Benchmark Dataset for Isometric Pose Evaluation
description: "arXiv:2506.11774v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Isometric exercises\
  \ appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and minimal dependence on\
  \ equipments. However, such fitness training is often overdependent on unreliable\
  \ digital media content instead of expert supervision, introducing serious risks,\
  \ including incorrect posture, injury, and disengagement due to lack of corrective\
  \ feedback. To address these challenges, we present a real-time feedback system\
  \ for assessing isometric poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest\
  \ multiclass isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips\
  \ across six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,\
  \ we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this dataset\
  \ and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification accuracy,\
  \ mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the feasibility\
  \ of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home workouts. This\
  \ expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also expands the potential\
  \ applications of these systems to rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and various other\
  \ fitness disciplines that involve physical motion."
