title: Voxel-Level Brain States Prediction Using Swin Transformer
description: "arXiv:2506.11455v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Understanding brain\
  \ dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic\
  \ resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through\
  \ blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In\
  \ this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due\
  \ to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI\
  \ data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin)\
  \ Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a\
  \ convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and\
  \ temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from\
  \ the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model\
  \ has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based\
  \ on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble\
  \ BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal\
  \ organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at\
  \ high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and\
  \ the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future."
