title: 'Vision-Language Models for Edge Networks: A Comprehensive Survey'
description: "arXiv:2502.07855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Vision Large\
  \ Language Models (VLMs) combine visual understanding with natural language processing,\
  \ enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and video analysis.\
  \ While VLMs show impressive capabilities across domains such as autonomous vehicles,\
