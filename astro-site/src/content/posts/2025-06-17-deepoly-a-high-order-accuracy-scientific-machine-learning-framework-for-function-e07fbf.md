title: 'DeePoly: A High-Order Accuracy Scientific Machine Learning Framework for Function
  Approximation and Solving PDEs'
description: "arXiv:2506.04613v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recently, machine\
  \ learning methods have gained significant traction in scientific computing, particularly\
  \ for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, methods based on deep\
  \ neural networks (DNNs) often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency\
  \ compared to traditional numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel\
  \ framework that transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter\
  \ optimization to a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex\
  \ global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted\
  \ features (Spotter) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination\
  \ leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at approximating\
  \ complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and stabilize the polynomial\
  \ approximation while polynomial bases provide high-precision local corrections\
  \ with convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate\
  \ that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency\
  \ across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.\
