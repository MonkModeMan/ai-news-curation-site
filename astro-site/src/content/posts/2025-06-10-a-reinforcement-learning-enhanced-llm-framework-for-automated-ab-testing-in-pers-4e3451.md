title: A Reinforcement-Learning-Enhanced LLM Framework for Automated A/B Testing in
  Personalized Marketing
description: "arXiv:2506.06316v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: For personalized\
  \ marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm the A/B testing to\
  \ maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this paper, we present a\
  \ new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using reinforcement learning strategy\
  \ optimization combined with LLM to automate and personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB\

  \ current interaction state. The content version is then selected in real-time through\
  \ the policy optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue\
  \ is estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and conversion\
  \ rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded into the framework\
  \ to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to generalize policy across\
  \ multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority\

  \ A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and benchmark reinforcement learning approaches\
  \ on real-world marketing data."
