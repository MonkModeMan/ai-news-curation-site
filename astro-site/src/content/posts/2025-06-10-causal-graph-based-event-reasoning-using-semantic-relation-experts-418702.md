title: Causal Graph based Event Reasoning using Semantic Relation Experts
description: "arXiv:2506.06910v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how\
  \ events in a scenario causally connect with each other is important for effectively\
  \ modeling and reasoning about events. But event reasoning remains a difficult challenge,\
  \ and despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately\
  \ identify causal connections between events. This struggle leads to poor performance\
  \ on deeper reasoning tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To\
  \ address this challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g.,\
  \ A enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality\
  \ during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as\
  \ well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to\
  \ causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on specific\
  \ semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of discussions which\
  \ are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate the utility of causal\
  \ graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications, and also introduce a\
  \ new explainable event prediction task that requires a causal chain of events in\
  \ the explanation. These explanations are more informative and coherent than baseline\
  \ generations. Finally, our overall approach not finetuned on any downstream task,\
  \ achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting\
  \ and next event prediction tasks."
