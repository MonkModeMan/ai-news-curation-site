title: 'Explainability of Large Language Models using SMILE: Statistical Model-agnostic
  Interpretability with Local Explanations'
description: "arXiv:2505.21657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large language\
  \ models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly powerful at generating\
  \ text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to understand how they decide\
  \ what to say. That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields\
  \ where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE,\
  \ a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt.\
  \ SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how\
  \ the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create\
  \ simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested\
  \ SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency,\
  \ stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations.\
  \ By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to\
  \ making AI more transparent and trustworthy."
