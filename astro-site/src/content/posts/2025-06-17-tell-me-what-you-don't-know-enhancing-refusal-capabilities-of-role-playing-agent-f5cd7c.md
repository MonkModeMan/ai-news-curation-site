title: 'Tell Me What You Don''t Know: Enhancing Refusal Capabilities of Role-Playing
  Agents via Representation Space Analysis and Editing'
description: "arXiv:2409.16913v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Role-Playing Agents\
  \ (RPAs) have shown remarkable performance in various applications, yet they often\
  \ struggle to recognize and appropriately respond to hard queries that conflict\
  \ with their role-play knowledge. To investigate RPAs' performance when faced with\
  \ different types of conflicting requests, we develop an evaluation benchmark that\
  \ includes contextual knowledge conflicting requests, parametric knowledge conflicting\
  \ requests, and non-conflicting requests to assess RPAs' ability to identify conflicts\
  \ and refuse to answer appropriately without over-refusing. Through extensive evaluation,\
  \ we find that most RPAs behave significant performance gaps toward different conflict\
  \ requests. To elucidate the reasons, we conduct an in-depth representation-level\
  \ analysis of RPAs under various conflict scenarios. Our findings reveal the existence\
  \ of rejection regions and direct response regions within the model's forwarding\
  \ representation, and thus influence the RPA's final response behavior. Therefore,\
  \ we introduce a lightweight representation editing approach that conveniently shifts\
  \ conflicting requests to the rejection region, thereby enhancing the model's refusal\
  \ accuracy. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our editing method,\
  \ improving RPAs' refusal ability of conflicting requests while maintaining their\
  \ general role-playing capabilities."
