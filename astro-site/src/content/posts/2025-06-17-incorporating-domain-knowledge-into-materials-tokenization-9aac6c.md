title: Incorporating Domain Knowledge into Materials Tokenization
description: "arXiv:2506.11115v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While language models\

Title:Incorporating Domain Knowledge into Materials Tokenization
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for natural language processing.
