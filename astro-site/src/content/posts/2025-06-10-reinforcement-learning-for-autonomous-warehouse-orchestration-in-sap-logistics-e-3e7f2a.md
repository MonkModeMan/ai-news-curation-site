  Execution: Redefining Supply Chain Agility'
description: "arXiv:2506.06523v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In an era of escalating\
  \ supply chain demands, SAP Logistics Execution (LE) is pivotal for managing warehouse\
  \ operations, transportation, and delivery. This research introduces a pioneering\
  \ framework leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously orchestrate warehouse\
  \ tasks in SAP LE, enhancing operational agility and efficiency. By modeling warehouse\
  \ processes as dynamic environments, the framework optimizes task allocation, inventory\
