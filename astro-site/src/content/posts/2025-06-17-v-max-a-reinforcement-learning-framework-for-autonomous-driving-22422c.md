title: 'V-Max: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving'
description: "arXiv:2503.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Learning-based\
  \ decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD)\
  \ policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation\
  \ Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human\
  \ demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution\
  \ shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative,\
  \ yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient\
  \ research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework\
  \ providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built\
  \ on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation.\
  \ We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse\
