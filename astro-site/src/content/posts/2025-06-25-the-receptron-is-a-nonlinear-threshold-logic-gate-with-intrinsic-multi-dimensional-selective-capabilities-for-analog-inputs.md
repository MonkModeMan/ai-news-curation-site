title: "The receptron is a nonlinear threshold logic gate with intrinsic multi-dimensional selective capabilities for analog inputs"
description: "arXiv:2506.19642v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex training."
