title: 'No Universal Prompt: Unifying Reasoning through Adaptive Prompting for Temporal
  Table Reasoning'
description: "arXiv:2506.11246v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Temporal Table Reasoning\
  \ is a critical challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring effective\
  \ prompting techniques to extract relevant insights. Despite existence of multiple\
  \ prompting methods, their impact on table reasoning remains largely unexplored.\
  \ Furthermore, the performance of these models varies drastically across different\
  \ table and context structures, making it difficult to determine an optimal approach.\
  \ This work investigates multiple prompting technique across diverse table types\
  \ to determine optimal approaches for different scenarios. We find that performance\
  \ varies based on entity type, table structure, requirement of additional context\
  \ and question complexity, with NO single method consistently outperforming others.\
  \ To mitigate these challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework\
  \ inspired by human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics\
  \ and integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves\
  \ superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline prompting\
  \ techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure refactoring,\
  \ finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning."
