title: Evidential Spectrum-Aware Contrastive Learning for OOD Detection in Dynamic
  Graphs
description: "arXiv:2506.07417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recently,\
  \ Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims to identify\
  \ whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the in-distribution (ID)\
  \ training set, has garnered considerable attention in security-sensitive fields.\
  \ Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on static graphs and confront\
  \ two critical challenges: i) high bias and high variance caused by single-point\
  \ estimation, which makes the predictions sensitive to randomness in the data; ii)\
  \ score homogenization resulting from the lack of OOD training data, where the model\
  \ only learns ID-specific patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow\
  \ score gap between ID and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate\
  \ OOD detection in dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).\
  \ Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via\
  \ Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural\
  \ network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution, explaining\

  \ by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware augmentation module generates\
  \ OOD approximations to identify patterns with high OOD scores, thereby widening\
  \ the score gap between ID and OOD data and mitigating score homogenization. Extensive\
  \ experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects\
  \ OOD samples in dynamic graphs."
