title: 'HypRL: Reinforcement Learning of Control Policies for Hyperproperties'
description: "arXiv:2504.04675v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Reward shaping\
  \ in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant\
  \ challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot\
  \ efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement\
  \ learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed\
  \ in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives\
  \ and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies\
  \ that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\\phi$, we apply Skolemization\
  \ to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions\
  \ to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown\
  \ transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively\
  \ maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying\
  \ $\\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware\
  \ planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare\
  \ with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency\
  \ of HYPRL."

Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions.
