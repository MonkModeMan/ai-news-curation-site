title: 'Dynamic Context Tuning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing Multi-Turn
  Planning and Tool Adaptation'
description: "arXiv:2506.11092v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Retrieval-Augmented\
  \ Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by grounding\
  \ their outputs in external tools and knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems\
  \ are typically constrained to static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets,\
  \ making them ill-suited for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes,\
  \ where user intent, available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We\
  \ present Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG\
  \ to support multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring\
  \ retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant\
  \ past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific tools,\
  \ and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context limits.\
  \ Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT improves\
  \ plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching GPT-4 performance\
  \ at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to previously unseen\
  \ tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a wide range of dynamic\
  \ environments."
