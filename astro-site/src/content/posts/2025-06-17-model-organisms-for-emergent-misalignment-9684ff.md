title: Model Organisms for Emergent Misalignment
description: "arXiv:2506.11613v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent work discovered\
  \ Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language models on narrowly harmful\
  \ datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned. A survey of experts prior\
  \ to publication revealed this was highly unexpected, demonstrating critical gaps\
  \ in our understanding of model alignment. In this work, we both advance understanding\
  \ and provide tools for future research. Using new narrowly misaligned datasets,\
  \ we create a set of improved model organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67%\

  \ using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across\
  \ diverse model sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including\
  \ full supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate\
  \ a mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust\
  \ behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language\
  \ models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from\
