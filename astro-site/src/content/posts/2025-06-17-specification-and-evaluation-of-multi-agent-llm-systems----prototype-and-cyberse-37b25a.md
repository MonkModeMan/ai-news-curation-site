title: Specification and Evaluation of Multi-Agent LLM Systems -- Prototype and Cybersecurity
  Applications
description: "arXiv:2506.10467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advancements\
  \ in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities\
  \ in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific\
  \ domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized\
  \ that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and\
  \ software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge\
  \ of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs,\
  \ reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification\
  \ and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent\
  \ LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for\
  \ specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning\
  \ techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory\
  \ research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The\
  \ system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification\
  \ is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks\
