title: Spatiotemporal Field Generation Based on Hybrid Mamba-Transformer with Physics-informed
  Fine-tuning
description: "arXiv:2505.11578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This research\
  \ confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered\
  \ in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained\
  \ models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed\
  \ based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured\
  \ grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information,\
  \ is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical\
  \ equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient\
  \ gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning\
  \ process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency\
  \ while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid\
  \ Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal\
  \ fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant\
  \ physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess\
  \ the accuracy and realism of physical field generation."
