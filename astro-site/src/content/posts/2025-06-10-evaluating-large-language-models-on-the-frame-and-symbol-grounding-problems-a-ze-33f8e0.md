title: 'Evaluating Large Language Models on the Frame and Symbol Grounding Problems:
  A Zero-shot Benchmark'
description: "arXiv:2506.07896v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advancements\
  \ in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized philosophical debates surrounding\
  \ artificial intelligence. Two of the most fundamental challenges - namely, the\
  \ Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding Problem - have historically been viewed\
  \ as unsolvable within traditional symbolic AI systems. This study investigates\
  \ whether modern LLMs possess the cognitive capacities required to address these\
  \ problems. To do so, I designed two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical\
  \ core of each problem, administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent\
  \ LLMs (both closed and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs\
  \ across five trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including\
  \ contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The results\
  \ demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in performance due\
  \ to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction tuning, several closed\
  \ models consistently achieved high scores. These findings suggest that select modern\
  \ LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to produce meaningful and stable responses\
  \ to these long-standing theoretical challenges."
