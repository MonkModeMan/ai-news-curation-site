title: 'AssertBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Self-Assertion in Large Language Models'
description: "arXiv:2506.11110v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent benchmarks\
  \ have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness in Large Language Models\
  \ (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how directional framing of factually\
  \ true statements influences model agreement, a common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench\
  \ addresses this by sampling evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification\
  \ dataset. For each (evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one\
  \ where the user claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the\
  \ user claims it is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning.\
  \ The desired outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth\
  \ evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree\
  \ with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the model's\
  \ underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the model's accuracy\
  \ on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this benchmark aims\
  \ to measure an LLM's ability to \"stick to its guns\" when presented with contradictory\

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset.
