title: 'MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing: Predicting Image Adjustments Utilizing MiniGPT-4'
description: "arXiv:2406.00971v2 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Vision-Language\
  \ Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements through integrating\
  \ with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process image and text modalities\
  \ simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction\
  \ between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing,\
  \ which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the\
  \ edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional\
  \ high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the\
  \ interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual\
  \ context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this\
  \ paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments\
  \ demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for\
  \ more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available at this \\href{https://github.com/VahidAz/MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing}"
