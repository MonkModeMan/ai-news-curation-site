title: "Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs"
description: "arXiv:2506.19185v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being. We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset, which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729 spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score, 15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this emerging area."
