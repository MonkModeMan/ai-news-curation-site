title: Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook
description: "arXiv:2506.09095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Foundation\
  \ models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from\
  \ large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated\
  \ examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can\
  \ later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision.\
  \ In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology,\
  \ radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain\
  \ the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised\
  \ learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how\
  \ FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications.\
  \ Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research."
