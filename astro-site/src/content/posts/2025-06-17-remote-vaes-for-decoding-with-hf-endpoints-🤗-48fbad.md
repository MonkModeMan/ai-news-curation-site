Remote VAEs for decoding with Inference Endpoints ü§ó
When operating with latent-space diffusion models for high-resolution image and video synthesis, the VAE decoder can consume quite a bit more memory. This makes it hard for the users to run these models on consumer GPUs without going through latency sacrifices and others alike.
For example, with offloading, there is a device transfer overhead, causing delays in the overall inference latency. Tiling is another solution that lets us operate on so-called ‚Äútiles‚Äù of inputs. However, it can have a negative impact on the quality of the final image.
Therefore, we want to pilot an idea with the community ‚Äî delegating the decoding process to a remote endpoint.
No data is stored or tracked, and code is open source. We made some changes to huggingface-inference-toolkit and use custom handlers.
This experimental feature is developed by Diffusers üß®

Getting started
Below, we cover three use cases where we think this remote VAE inference would be beneficial.
Code
First, we have created a helper method for interacting with Remote VAEs.
Install
diffusers
frommain
to run the code.pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers@main
Code
from diffusers.utils.remote_utils import remote_decode
Basic example
Here, we show how to use the remote VAE on random tensors.
Code
image = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://q1bj3bpq6kzilnsu.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=torch.randn([1, 4, 64, 64], dtype=torch.float16),
scaling_factor=0.18215,
)
Usage for Flux is slightly different. Flux latents are packed so we need to send the height
and width
.
Code
image = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://whhx50ex1aryqvw6.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=torch.randn([1, 4096, 64], dtype=torch.float16),
height=1024,
width=1024,
scaling_factor=0.3611,
shift_factor=0.1159,
)
Finally, an example for HunyuanVideo.
Code
video = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://o7ywnmrahorts457.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=torch.randn([1, 16, 3, 40, 64], dtype=torch.float16),
output_type="mp4",
)
with open("video.mp4", "wb") as f:
f.write(video)
Generation
But we want to use the VAE on an actual pipeline to get an actual image, not random noise. The example below shows how to do it with SD v1.5.
Code
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
"stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
torch_dtype=torch.float16,
variant="fp16",
vae=None,
).to("cuda")
prompt = "Strawberry ice cream, in a stylish modern glass, coconut, splashing milk cream and honey, in a gradient purple background, fluid motion, dynamic movement, cinematic lighting, Mysterious"
latent = pipe(
prompt=prompt,
output_type="latent",
).images
image = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://q1bj3bpq6kzilnsu.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=latent,
scaling_factor=0.18215,
)
image.save("test.jpg")
Here‚Äôs another example with Flux.
Code
from diffusers import FluxPipeline
pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
"black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell",
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
vae=None,
).to("cuda")
prompt = "Strawberry ice cream, in a stylish modern glass, coconut, splashing milk cream and honey, in a gradient purple background, fluid motion, dynamic movement, cinematic lighting, Mysterious"
latent = pipe(
prompt=prompt,
guidance_scale=0.0,
num_inference_steps=4,
output_type="latent",
).images
image = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://whhx50ex1aryqvw6.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=latent,
height=1024,
width=1024,
scaling_factor=0.3611,
shift_factor=0.1159,
)
image.save("test.jpg")
Here‚Äôs an example with HunyuanVideo.
Code
from diffusers import HunyuanVideoPipeline, HunyuanVideoTransformer3DModel
model_id = "hunyuanvideo-community/HunyuanVideo"
transformer = HunyuanVideoTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained(
model_id, subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)
pipe = HunyuanVideoPipeline.from_pretrained(
model_id, transformer=transformer, vae=None, torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")
latent = pipe(
prompt="A cat walks on the grass, realistic",
height=320,
width=512,
num_frames=61,
num_inference_steps=30,
output_type="latent",
).frames
video = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://o7ywnmrahorts457.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=latent,
output_type="mp4",
)
if isinstance(video, bytes):
with open("video.mp4", "wb") as f:
f.write(video)
Queueing
One of the great benefits of using a remote VAE is that we can queue multiple generation requests. While the current latent is being processed for decoding, we can already queue another one. This helps improve concurrency.
Code
import queue
import threading
from IPython.display import display
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
def decode_worker(q: queue.Queue):
while True:
item = q.get()
if item is None:
break
image = remote_decode(
endpoint="https://q1bj3bpq6kzilnsu.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/",
tensor=item,
scaling_factor=0.18215,
)
display(image)
q.task_done()
q = queue.Queue()
thread = threading.Thread(target=decode_worker, args=(q,), daemon=True)
thread.start()
def decode(latent: torch.Tensor):
q.put(latent)
prompts = [
"Blueberry ice cream, in a stylish modern glass , ice cubes, nuts, mint leaves, splashing milk cream, in a gradient purple background, fluid motion, dynamic movement, cinematic lighting, Mysterious",

]
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
"Lykon/dreamshaper-8",
torch_dtype=torch.float16,
vae=None,
).to("cuda")
pipe.unet = pipe.unet.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)
pipe.unet = torch.compile(pipe.unet, mode="reduce-overhead", fullgraph=True)
_ = pipe(
prompt=prompts[0],
output_type="latent",
)
for prompt in prompts:
latent = pipe(
prompt=prompt,
output_type="latent",
).images
decode(latent)
q.put(None)
thread.join()

Advantages of using a remote VAE
These tables demonstrate the VRAM requirements with different GPUs. Memory usage % determines whether users of a certain GPU will need to offload. Offload times vary with CPU, RAM and HDD/NVMe. Tiled decoding increases inference time.
