title: "Fake or Real, Can Robots Tell? Evaluating Embodied Vision-Language Models on Real and 3D-Printed Objects"
description: "arXiv:2506.19579v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models (VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations. Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for embodied agents in real-world settings."
