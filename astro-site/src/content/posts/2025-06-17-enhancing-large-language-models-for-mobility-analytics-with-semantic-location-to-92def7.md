title: Enhancing Large Language Models for Mobility Analytics with Semantic Location
  Tokenization
description: "arXiv:2506.11109v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The widespread adoption\
  \ of location-based services has led to the generation of vast amounts of mobility\
  \ data, providing significant opportunities to model user movement dynamics within\
  \ urban environments. Recent advancements have focused on adapting Large Language\
  \ Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics. However, existing methods face two primary\
  \ limitations: inadequate semantic representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs)\
  \ and insufficient modeling of mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated\
  \ instruction fine-tuning). To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel\
  \ framework that significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces\
  \ a location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to\
  \ represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring compatibility\
  \ with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of complementary fine-tuning\
  \ objectives that align the learned tokens with the internal representations in\
  \ LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of sequential movement patterns and\
  \ location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob framework not only enhances LLMs' ability\
  \ to interpret mobility data but also provides a more generalizable approach for\
  \ various mobility analytics tasks. Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate\
  \ the superior performance in both next-location prediction and mobility recovery\
  \ tasks, outperforming existing deep learning and LLM-based methods."
