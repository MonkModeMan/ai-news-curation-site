description: "arXiv:2506.06881v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep knowledge analysis\
  \ tasks always involve the systematic extraction and association of knowledge from\
  \ large volumes of data, followed by logical reasoning to discover insights. However,\
  \ to solve such complex tasks, existing deep research frameworks face three major\

  \ 2) They operate purely online, making it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared\
  \ and large-scale knowledge; 3) They cannot perform complex knowledge computation,\

  \ capability. Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization\

View PDFAbstract:Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR}) framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability. Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline. Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
