title: 'PIPO: Pipelined Offloading for Efficient Inference on Consumer Devices'
description: "arXiv:2504.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The high\
  \ memory and computation demand of large language models (LLMs) makes them challenging\
  \ to be deployed on consumer devices due to limited GPU memory. Offloading can mitigate\
  \ the memory constraint but often suffers from low GPU utilization, leading to low\
  \ inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called pipelined\
  \ offloading (PIPO), for efficient inference on consumer devices. PIPO designs a\
  \ fine-grained offloading pipeline, complemented with optimized data transfer and\
  \ computation, to achieve high concurrency and efficient scheduling for inference.\
  \ Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art baseline, PIPO increases\
  \ GPU utilization from below 40% to over 90% and achieves up to 3.1$\\times$ higher\
  \ throughput, running on a laptop equipped with a RTX3060 GPU of 6GB memory."
