title: Synthetic Geology -- Structural Geology Meets Deep Learning

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important applications, is coming within reach through deep learning.
