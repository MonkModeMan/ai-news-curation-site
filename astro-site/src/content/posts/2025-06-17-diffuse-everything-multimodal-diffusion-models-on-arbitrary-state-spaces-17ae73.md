title: 'Diffuse Everything: Multimodal Diffusion Models on Arbitrary State Spaces'
description: "arXiv:2506.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Diffusion\
  \ models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating unimodal data across\
  \ various tasks, including image, video, and text generation. On the contrary, the\
  \ joint generation of multimodal data through diffusion models is still in the early\
  \ stages of exploration. Existing approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing\
  \ protocols, such as tokenizers and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied\
  \ data representations into a unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands\
  \ the high accuracy of encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications\
  \ with limited data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for\
  \ building multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native\
  \ generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an innovative\
  \ decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both unconditional and modality-conditioned\
  \ generation within a single model simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach\
  \ for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating\
  \ that it achieves competitive performance."
