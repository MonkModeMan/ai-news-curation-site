title: 'LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as a Clinical Evaluation
  Judge with Fuzzy Logic'
description: "arXiv:2506.11221v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clinical communication\
  \ skills are critical in medical education, and practicing and assessing clinical\
  \ communication skills on a scale is challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical\
  \ scenario simulations have shown promise in enhancing medical students' clinical\
  \ practice, providing automated and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced\
  \ physician judgment is difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language\
  \ Model (LLM) and proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning\
  \ the automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective\
  \ physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is fine-tuned\
  \ to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient conversation\
  \ scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including Professionalism,\
  \ Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction. The methodology\
  \ of this paper started from data collection from the LLM-powered medical education\
  \ system, data annotation based on multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt\
  \ engineering and the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using\
  \ these human annotations. The results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves\
  \ over 80\\% accuracy, with major criteria items over 90\\%, effectively leveraging\
  \ fuzzy logic and LLM as a solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment.\
