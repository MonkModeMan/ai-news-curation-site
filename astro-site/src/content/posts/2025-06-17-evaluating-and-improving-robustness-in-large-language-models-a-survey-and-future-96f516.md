title: 'Evaluating and Improving Robustness in Large Language Models: A Survey and
  Future Directions'
description: "arXiv:2506.11111v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large Language Models\
  \ (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years due to their capability\
  \ of understanding and generating natural languages. With the rapid development\
  \ and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied Intelligence), the robustness\
  \ of LLMs has received increased attention. As the core brain of many AI applications,\
  \ the robustness of LLMs requires that models should not only generate consistent\
  \ contents, but also ensure the correctness and stability of generated content when\
  \ dealing with unexpeted application scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise\
  \ domain data, outof-distribution (OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper,\
  \ we conduct a thorough review of the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive\
  \ terminology of concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.\

  \ as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD Robustness: dealing with\

  \ transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of Robustness: summarizing the\
