title: Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage via Poisoning Attack in Offline
  Reinforcement Learning
description: "arXiv:2506.11172v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Offline reinforcement\
  \ learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of pre-collected data over the target\
  \ policy's distribution. Existing studies aim to improve data-policy coverage to\
  \ mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook security risks from insufficient\
  \ coverage, and the single-step analysis is not consistent with the multi-step decision-making\
  \ nature of offline RL. To address this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability\

  \ and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate distributional shifts. Experiments\
