title: 'SWE-Dev: Building Software Engineering Agents with Training and Inference
  Scaling'
description: "arXiv:2506.07636v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models\
  \ (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational problem solving to addressing\
  \ real-world tasks involving tool use, such as software engineering (SWE). Recent\
  \ LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end\
  \ automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE\
  \ agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective\
  \ test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon\
  \ open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases\
  \ for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the\
  \ training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark\
  \ show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents.\
  \ Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach\
  \ 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models.\
