title: 'Mapping Human-Agent Co-Learning and Co-Adaptation: A Scoping Review'
description: "arXiv:2506.06324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Several papers have\
  \ delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning and co-adaptation. It\
  \ has been noted that the terminology used to describe this collaborative relationship\
  \ in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For example, the prefix \"co\"\
  \ is used interchangeably to represent both \"collaborative\" and \"mutual,\" and\
  \ the terms \"co-learning\" and \"co-adaptation\" are sometimes used interchangeably.\
  \ However, they can reflect subtle differences in the focus of the studies. The\
  \ current scoping review's primary research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing\
  \ papers discussing this collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers\
  \ use to describe this human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this\
  \ area of study, we are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent\
  \ agents and task domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2).\
  \ This exploration is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent\
  \ interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can\
  \ also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different\
  \ task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic, complex\
  \ domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive theories and\
  \ frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure human-agent\
  \ co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it can help us\
  \ understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent collaboration and adaptation,\
  \ and it can also guide us in identifying any new frameworks proposed specifically\
  \ for this type of relationship."
