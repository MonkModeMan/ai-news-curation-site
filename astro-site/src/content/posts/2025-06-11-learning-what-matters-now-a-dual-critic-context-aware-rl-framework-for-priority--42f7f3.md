title: 'Learning What Matters Now: A Dual-Critic Context-Aware RL Framework for Priority-Driven
  Information Gain'
description: "arXiv:2506.06786v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous systems\
  \ operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions must continuously gather\
  \ mission-critical information while flexibly adapting to shifting operational priorities.\
  \ We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic\
  \ reinforcement learning (RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration\
  \ strategy whenever mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic\
  \ critic for task reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location\
  \ awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers\
  \ transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to\
  \ re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where experiments\
  \ specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of information types\
  \ the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly four times higher mission-success\
  \ rates than baselines after a single priority shift and more than three times better\
  \ performance in multiple-shift scenarios, achieving 100% recovery while baseline\
  \ methods fail to adapt. These results highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete\
  \ environment with piecewise-stationary information-value distributions."
