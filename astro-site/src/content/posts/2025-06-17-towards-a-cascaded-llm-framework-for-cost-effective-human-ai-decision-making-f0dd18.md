title: Towards a Cascaded LLM Framework for Cost-effective Human-AI Decision-Making
description: "arXiv:2506.11887v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective human-AI\
  \ decision-making balances three key factors: the \\textit{correctness} of predictions,\
  \ the \\textit{cost} of knowledge and reasoning complexity, and the confidence about\
  \ whether to \\textit{abstain} automated answers or involve human experts. In this\
  \ work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks\
  \ across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers,\
  \ a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert\
  \ for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First,\
  \ a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate\
  \ it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy\
  \ decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires\
  \ human intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the\
  \ framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over time.\
  \ We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge)\
  \ and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results show that our\

  \ while reducing cost and providing a principled way to handle abstentions."
