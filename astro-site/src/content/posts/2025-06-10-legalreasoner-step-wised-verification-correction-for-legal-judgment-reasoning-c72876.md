title: 'LegalReasoner: Step-wised Verification-Correction for Legal Judgment Reasoning'
description: "arXiv:2506.07443v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Legal judgment prediction\
  \ (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final rulings based on case claims\
  \ and facts, which plays a vital role in the judicial domain for supporting court\
  \ decision-making and improving judicial efficiency. However, existing methods often\
  \ struggle with logical errors when conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose\
  \ LegalReasoner, which enhances LJP reliability through step-wise verification and\
  \ correction of the reasoning process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute\
  \ points to decompose complex cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while\
  \ employing a process verifier to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness,\
  \ and potential perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution\
  \ and resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,\
  \ we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with detailed\
  \ annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and process verification\
  \ labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner significantly improves concordance\
  \ with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available\
