Build rich, interactive web apps with an updated Gemini 2.5 Pro
Today we're releasing early access to Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O edition), an updated version of 2.5 Pro that has significantly improved capabilities for coding, especially building compelling interactive web apps. We were going to release this update at Google I/O in a couple weeks, but based on the overwhelming enthusiasm for this model, we wanted to get it in your hands sooner so people can start building.
This builds on the overwhelmingly positive feedback to Gemini 2.5 Pro’s coding and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Beyond UI-focused development, these improvements extend to other coding tasks such as code transformation, code editing and developing complex agentic workflows.
With these enhanced capabilities, 2.5 Pro now leads on the WebDev Arena Leaderboard, surpassing the previous version by +147 Elo points. This leaderboard measures human preference for a model’s ability to build aesthetically pleasing and functional web apps. It also continues to build on its strong foundation in native multimodality and long context; it has state-of-the-art performance in video understanding, with a score of 84.8% on the VideoMME benchmark.
Developers can start building with this updated Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. It’s also available for users in the Gemini app, powering features like Canvas, and enabling anyone to vibe code and build interactive web apps with a single prompt.
