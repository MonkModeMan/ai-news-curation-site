title: "Neural MMO: A massively multiagent game environment"
description: "We’re releasing a Neural MMO, a massively multiagent game environment for reinforcement learning agents. Our platform supports a large, variable number of agents within a persistent and open-ended task. The inclusion of many agents and species leads to better exploration, divergent niche formation, and greater overall competence."
