title: Will artificial agents pursue power by default?
description: "arXiv:2506.06352v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Researchers worried\
  \ about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued that we should expect sufficiently\
  \ capable AI agents to pursue power over humanity because power is a convergent\
  \ instrumental goal, something that is useful for a wide range of final goals. Others\

  \ the concepts of instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic\
  \ framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal.\
  \ I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but might turn\
  \ out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options cannot always\
  \ be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive information about the\

  \ for agents who have a good shot at attaining absolute or near-absolute power."

Title:Will artificial agents pursue power by default?
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining absolute or near-absolute power.
