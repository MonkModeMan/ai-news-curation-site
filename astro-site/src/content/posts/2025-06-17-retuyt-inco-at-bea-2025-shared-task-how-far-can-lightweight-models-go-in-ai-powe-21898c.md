title: 'RETUYT-INCO at BEA 2025 Shared Task: How Far Can Lightweight Models Go in
  AI-powered Tutor Evaluation?'
description: "arXiv:2506.11243v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In this paper, we\
  \ present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025 shared task. Our participation\
  \ was characterized by the decision of using relatively small models, with fewer\
  \ than 1B parameters. This self-imposed restriction tries to represent the conditions\
  \ in which many research labs or institutions are in the Global South, where computational\
  \ power is not easily accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive\
  \ self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of\
  \ teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\\ F_1$ scores\
  \ published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and the winners\
  \ were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in Track 3; $9.56$\
  \ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the minimum difference with\
  \ a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum difference is $13.13$ -- according\
  \ to the $exact\\ F_1$ score, we find that models with a size smaller than 1B parameters\
  \ are competitive for these tasks, all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget\
  \ GPU or even without a GPU."
