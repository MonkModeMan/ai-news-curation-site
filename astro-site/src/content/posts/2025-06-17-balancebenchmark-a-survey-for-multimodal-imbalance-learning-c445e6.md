title: 'BalanceBenchmark: A Survey for Multimodal Imbalance Learning'
description: "arXiv:2502.10816v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Multimodal\
  \ learning has gained attention for its capacity to integrate information from different\
  \ modalities. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem,\
  \ where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent\
  \ studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive\
  \ and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream\
  \ multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they\
  \ employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these\
  \ methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely\
  \ used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives:\
  \ performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we\
  \ have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental\
  \ workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark,\
  \ we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages\
  \ of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational\
  \ complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to\
  \ address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models. The\
  \ code of the toolkit is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/BalanceBenchmark."
