title: 'When Algorithms Play Favorites: Lookism in the Generation and Perception of
  Faces'
description: "arXiv:2506.11025v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper examines\
  \ how synthetically generated faces and machine learning-based gender classification\
  \ algorithms are affected by algorithmic lookism, the preferential treatment based\
  \ on appearance. In experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find\
  \ that: (1) text-to-image (T2I) systems tend to associate facial attractiveness\
  \ to unrelated positive traits like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender\
  \ classification models exhibit higher error rates on \"less-attractive\" faces,\
  \ especially among non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding\
  \ digital identity systems."
