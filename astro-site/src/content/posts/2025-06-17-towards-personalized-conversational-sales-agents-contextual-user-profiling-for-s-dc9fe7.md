title: 'Towards Personalized Conversational Sales Agents: Contextual User Profiling
  for Strategic Action'
description: "arXiv:2504.08754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Conversational\
  \ Recommender Systems (CRSs)aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored\
  \ recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving\
  \ items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making,\
  \ where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To capture this\
  \ complexity, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSALES), a novel task that integrates\
  \ preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion within a unified conversational\
  \ framework. To support realistic and systematic evaluation, we present CSUSER,\
  \ an evaluation protocol with LLM-based user simulator grounded in real-world behavioral\
  \ data by modeling fine-grained user profiles for personalized interaction. We also\
  \ propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual user\
  \ profiles and strategically selects actions through conversation. Comprehensive\
  \ experiments show that CSI significantly improves both recommendation success and\
  \ persuasive effectiveness across diverse user profiles."
