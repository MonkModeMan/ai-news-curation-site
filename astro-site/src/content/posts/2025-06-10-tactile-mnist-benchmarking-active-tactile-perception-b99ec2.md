title: 'Tactile MNIST: Benchmarking Active Tactile Perception'
description: "arXiv:2506.06361v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Tactile perception\
  \ has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous robotic manipulation by providing\
  \ rich local information that can complement or substitute for other sensory modalities\
  \ such as vision. However, because tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not\
  \ well-suited for tasks that require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding\
  \ on its own. A human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active\
  \ perception techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions\
  \ with more informative or significant features and integrate such information over\
  \ time in order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception\
  \ and different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention\
  \ recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.\
  \ To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an open-source,\
  \ Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active tactile perception\
  \ tasks, including localization, classification, and volume estimation. Our benchmark\
  \ suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from simple toy environments all the\
  \ way to complex tactile perception tasks using vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore,\
  \ we also offer a comprehensive dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit\
  \ models and 153,600 real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits.\
  \ Using this dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering.\
  \ By providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our\
  \ benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile sensing\
  \ and active perception."
