title: 'STARFlow: Scaling Latent Normalizing Flows for High-resolution Image Synthesis'
description: "arXiv:2506.06276v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We present STARFlow,\
  \ a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows that achieves strong performance\
  \ in high-resolution image synthesis. The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive\
  \ Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with\
  \ the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first\
  \ establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions.\
  \ Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic\
  \ innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein\
  \ a deep Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,\
  \ complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient\
  \ yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of pretrained autoencoders,\
  \ which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling; and (3) a novel\
  \ guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample quality. Crucially, our model\
  \ remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling exact maximum likelihood training\
  \ in continuous spaces without discretization. STARFlow achieves competitive performance\
  \ in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching\
  \ state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work\
  \ is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively\
  \ at this scale and resolution."
