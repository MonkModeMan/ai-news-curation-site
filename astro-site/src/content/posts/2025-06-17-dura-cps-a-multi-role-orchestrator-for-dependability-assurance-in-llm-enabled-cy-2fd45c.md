title: 'DURA-CPS: A Multi-Role Orchestrator for Dependability Assurance in LLM-Enabled
  Cyber-Physical Systems'
description: "arXiv:2506.06381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Cyber-Physical\
  \ Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to operate in critical\
  \ applications. However, traditional verification and validation methods often struggle\
  \ to handle the unpredictable and dynamic nature of AI components. In this paper,\
  \ we introduce DURA-CPS, a novel framework that employs multi-role orchestration\
  \ to automate the iterative assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized\
  \ roles (e.g., safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery\
  \ planning) to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, DURA-CPS continuously\
  \ evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability requirements.\
  \ We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an autonomous vehicle\
  \ navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our results show that DURA-CPS\
  \ effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages performance impacts, and supports\
  \ adaptive recovery strategies, thereby offering a structured and extensible solution\
  \ for rigorous V&amp;V in safety- and security-critical systems."
