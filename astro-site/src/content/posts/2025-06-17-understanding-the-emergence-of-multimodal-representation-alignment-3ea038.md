title: Understanding the Emergence of Multimodal Representation Alignment
description: "arXiv:2502.16282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Multimodal\
  \ representation learning is fundamentally about transforming incomparable modalities\
  \ into comparable representations. While prior research primarily focused on explicitly\
  \ aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model\
  \ architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal\
  \ models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with\
  \ each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence\
  \ of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and\
  \ why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator\
  \ of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate\
  \ that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance\
  \ depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily\
  \ limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between\
  \ redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest\
  \ that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance\
  \ varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners\
  \ determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or,\
  \ in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance. Code is released\
