title: 'Not All Clients Are Equal: Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous
  Multi-Modal Clients'
description: "arXiv:2506.11024v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Foundation models\
  \ have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse multi-modal tasks, but their\
  \ centralized training raises privacy concerns and induces high transmission costs.\
  \ In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a distributed alternative without\
  \ the need to share data. Recently, for the growing demand for personalizing AI\
  \ models for different user purposes, personalized federated learning (PFL) has\
  \ emerged. PFL allows each client to leverage the knowledge of other clients for\
  \ further adaptation to individual user preferences, again without the need to share\
  \ data. Despite its potential, most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments,\
  \ overlooking the data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios.\
  \ In contrast, we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark\
  \ for multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution\
  \ shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all\
  \ clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we propose\
  \ a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides customized global\
  \ models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a dimension-invariant\
  \ module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous models. Empirical validations\
  \ demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling\
  \ in both personalization and generalization capabilities."
