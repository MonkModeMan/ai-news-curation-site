title: Control Industrial Automation System with Large Language Model Agents
description: "arXiv:2409.18009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Traditional\
  \ industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex\
  \ reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence\
  \ to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial\
  \ settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs\
  \ to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of\
  \ the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured\
  \ prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides\
  \ real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events\
  \ on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information,\
  \ generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It\
  \ also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application\
  \ of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation,\
  \ and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing.\
  \ This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous\
  \ events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language\
  \ for more intuitive human-machine interaction. We provide demo videos and detailed\
  \ data on GitHub: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLM4IAS."
