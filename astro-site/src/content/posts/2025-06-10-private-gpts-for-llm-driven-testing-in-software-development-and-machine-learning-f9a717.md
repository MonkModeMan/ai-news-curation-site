title: Private GPTs for LLM-driven testing in software development and machine learning
description: "arXiv:2506.06509v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In this contribution,\
  \ we examine the capability of private GPTs to automatically generate executable\
  \ test code based on requirements. More specifically, we use acceptance criteria\
  \ as input, formulated as part of epics, or stories, which are typically used in\
  \ modern development processes. This gives product owners, or business intelligence,\
  \ respectively, a way to directly produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs.\
  \ We explore the quality of the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting\
  \ the LLM generate code from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using\
  \ Gherkin syntax. As a result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better\
  \ results -where we define better in terms of human readability and best coding\
  \ practices, i.e. lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in\
  \ testing. Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a\
  \ simple \"Hello World\" program and a digit classification model, showing that\
  \ structured prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs."
