title: 'The Automated but Risky Game: Modeling Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transactions
  in Consumer Markets'
description: "arXiv:2506.00073v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: AI agents are\
  \ increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as\
  \ product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore\
  \ a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully\
  \ automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1)\
  \ Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users?\
  \ (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer\
  \ markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that\
  \ evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and\
  \ transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently\
  \ imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for\
  \ their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses\
  \ for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable\
  \ deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency,\
  \ it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating\
  \ business decisions to AI agents."
