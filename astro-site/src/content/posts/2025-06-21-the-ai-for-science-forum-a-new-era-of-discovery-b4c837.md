A new era of discovery
James Manyika’s opening remarks from the AI for Science Forum.
AI is revolutionizing the landscape of scientific research, enabling advancements at a pace that was once unimaginable — from accelerating drug discovery to designing new materials for clean energy technologies. The AI for Science Forum — co-hosted by Google DeepMind and the Royal Society — brought together the scientific community, policymakers, and industry leaders to explore the transformative potential of AI to drive scientific breakthroughs, address the world's most pressing challenges, and lead to a new era of discovery.
