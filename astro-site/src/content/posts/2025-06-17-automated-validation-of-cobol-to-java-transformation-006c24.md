title: Automated Validation of COBOL to Java Transformation
description: "arXiv:2506.10999v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances\
  \ in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques have made it feasible\
  \ to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages such as COBOL to modern\
  \ languages such as Java or Python. While the results of LLM-based automatic transformation\
  \ are encouraging, the resulting code cannot be trusted to correctly translate the\
  \ original code. We propose a framework and a tool to help validate the equivalence\
  \ of COBOL and translated Java. The results can also help repair the code if there\
  \ are some issues and provide feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed\
  \ a symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests\
  \ for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We\
  \ generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run\
  \ them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs."
