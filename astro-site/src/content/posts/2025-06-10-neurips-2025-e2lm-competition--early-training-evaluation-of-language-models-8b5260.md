title: 'NeurIPS 2025 E2LM Competition : Early Training Evaluation of Language Models'
description: "arXiv:2506.07731v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Existing benchmarks\
  \ have proven effective for assessing the performance of fully trained large language\
  \ models. However, we find striking differences in the early training stages of\
  \ small models, where benchmarks often fail to provide meaningful or discriminative\
  \ signals. To explore how these differences arise, this competition tackles the\
  \ challenge of designing scientific knowledge evaluation tasks specifically tailored\
  \ for measuring early training progress of language models. Participants are invited\
  \ to develop novel evaluation methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better\
  \ capture performance differences among language models. To support this effort,\
  \ we provide three pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along\
  \ with intermediate checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments\
  \ and development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,\
  \ making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.\
  \ Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality of the performance\
  \ signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1 trillion tokens of\
  \ training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge domain. By promoting\
  \ the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early training, this competition\
  \ aims to attract a broad range of participants from various disciplines, including\
  \ those who may not be machine learning experts or have access to dedicated GPU\
  \ resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to make foundational LLM research\
  \ more systematic and benchmark-informed from the earliest phases of model development."
