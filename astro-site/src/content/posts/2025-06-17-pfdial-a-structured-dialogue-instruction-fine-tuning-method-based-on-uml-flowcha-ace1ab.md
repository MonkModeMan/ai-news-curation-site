title: 'PFDial: A Structured Dialogue Instruction Fine-tuning Method Based on UML
  Flowcharts'
description: "arXiv:2503.06706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Process-driven\
  \ dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are\
  \ essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large\
  \ Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning,\
  \ they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address\
  \ this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains\
  \ 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts\
  \ containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart\
  \ is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental\
  \ results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B\
  \ model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B\
  \ model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate\
  \ models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct\
  \ an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model\
  \ performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released\
  \ in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/PFDial."
