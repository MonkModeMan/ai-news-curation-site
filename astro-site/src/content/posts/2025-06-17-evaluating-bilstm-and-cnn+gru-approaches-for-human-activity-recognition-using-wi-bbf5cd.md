title: Evaluating BiLSTM and CNN+GRU Approaches for Human Activity Recognition Using
  WiFi CSI Data
description: "arXiv:2506.11165v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper compares\
  \ the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning models for Human Activity\
  \ Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State Information (CSI) datasets:\
  \ UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that the CNN+GRU model has a higher\
  \ accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks to its ability to extract spatial\
  \ features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model performs better on the high-resolution\
  \ NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by extracting long-term temporal dependencies more\
  \ effectively. The findings strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics\
  \ and preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the\
  \ real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and intelligent\
  \ home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity recognition."
