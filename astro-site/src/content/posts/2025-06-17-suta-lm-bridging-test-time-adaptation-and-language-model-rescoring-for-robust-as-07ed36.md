title: 'SUTA-LM: Bridging Test-Time Adaptation and Language Model Rescoring for Robust
  ASR'
description: "arXiv:2506.11121v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Despite progress\
  \ in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause performance drops,\
  \ which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by adjusting models during inference.\
  \ Recent work explores combining TTA with external language models, using techniques\
  \ like beam search rescoring or generative error correction. In this work, we identify\
  \ a previously overlooked challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring,\
  \ revealing the nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based\
  \ on this insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA,\
  \ an entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM\
  \ first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection\
  \ mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by language\
  \ model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR datasets\
  \ show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of domains."
