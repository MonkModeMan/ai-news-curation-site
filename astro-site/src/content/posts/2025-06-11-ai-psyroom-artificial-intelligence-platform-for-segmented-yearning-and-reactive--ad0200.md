title: 'AI PsyRoom: Artificial Intelligence Platform for Segmented Yearning and Reactive
  Outcome Optimization Method'
description: "arXiv:2506.06740v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Psychological counseling\
  \ faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for mental health services and\
  \ the shortage of trained professionals. Large language models (LLMs) have shown\
  \ potential to assist psychological counseling, especially in empathy and emotional\
  \ support. However, existing models lack a deep understanding of emotions and are\
  \ unable to generate personalized treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions.\
  \ To address these shortcomings, we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation\
  \ framework designed to enhance psychological counseling by generating empathetic\
  \ and emotionally nuanced conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification\
  \ and a multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue\
  \ reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which contains\
  \ 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues. We also\
  \ propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans. Quantitative evaluations\
  \ demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\
  \ achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23% in expression, 24% in Empathy,\
  \ and 16% in interactive communication quality. The datasets and models are publicly\
  \ available, providing a foundation for advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling\
  \ research."

Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling, especially in empathy and emotional support.

To address these shortcomings, we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues.
