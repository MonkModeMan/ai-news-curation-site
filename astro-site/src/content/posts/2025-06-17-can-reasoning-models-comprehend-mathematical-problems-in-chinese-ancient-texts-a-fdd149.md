title: Can reasoning models comprehend mathematical problems in Chinese ancient texts?
  An empirical study based on data from Suanjing Shishu
description: "arXiv:2505.16660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This study\
  \ addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese ancient mathematical\
  \ classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical texts\
  \ based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses the mathematical problem-solving\
  \ capabilities of mainstream reasoning models under the unique linguistic constraints\
  \ of classical Chinese. Through machine-assisted annotation and manual verification,\
  \ 538 mathematical problems were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured\
  \ dataset centered on the \"Question-Answer-Solution\" framework, supplemented by\
  \ problem types and difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous\
  \ problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were\
  \ designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese\
  \ mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially comprehend\
  \ and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains inferior to benchmarks\
  \ on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models' classical Chinese comprehension\
  \ and cultural knowledge should be prioritized for optimization. This study provides\
  \ methodological support for mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and\
  \ disseminating traditional culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating\
  \ cross-linguistic and cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models."
