title: 'CR-BLEA: Contrastive Ranking for Adaptive Resource Allocation in Bilevel Evolutionary
  Algorithms'
description: "arXiv:2506.06362v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Bilevel optimization\
  \ poses a significant computational challenge due to its nested structure, where\
  \ each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a corresponding lower-level\

  \ this issue, we propose a novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that\
