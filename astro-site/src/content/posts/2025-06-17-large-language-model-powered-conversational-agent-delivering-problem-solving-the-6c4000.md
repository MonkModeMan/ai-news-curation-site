title: 'Large Language Model-Powered Conversational Agent Delivering Problem-Solving
  Therapy (PST) for Family Caregivers: Enhancing Empathy and Therapeutic Alliance
  Using In-Context Learning'
description: "arXiv:2506.11376v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Family caregivers\
  \ often face substantial mental health challenges due to their multifaceted roles\
  \ and limited resources. This study explored the potential of a large language model\
  \ (LLM)-powered conversational agent to deliver evidence-based mental health support\
  \ for caregivers, specifically Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational\
  \ Interviewing (MI) and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment\
  \ was conducted with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate\
  \ empathy and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot\
  \ and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside clinician-curated\
  \ examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding and personalized\
  \ support, as reflected by qualitative responses and quantitative ratings on perceived\
  \ empathy and therapeutic alliances. Participants valued the model's ability to\
  \ validate emotions, explore unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies.\
  \ However, balancing thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains\
  \ a challenge. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic\
  \ and tailored support for family caregivers."
