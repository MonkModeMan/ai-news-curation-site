title: 'Data Science: a Natural Ecosystem'
description: "arXiv:2506.11010v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This manuscript\
  \ provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term essential data science,\
  \ as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the data universe\
  \ with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain,\
  \ cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data\
  \ agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract\
  \ entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions.\
  \ Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We\
  \ define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the\
  \ definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines\
  \ with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science\
  \ into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat\
  \ of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,\
  \ if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be useful\
  \ or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data\
  \ universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence."

Title:Data Science: a Natural Ecosystem
View PDFAbstract:This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially, if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.
