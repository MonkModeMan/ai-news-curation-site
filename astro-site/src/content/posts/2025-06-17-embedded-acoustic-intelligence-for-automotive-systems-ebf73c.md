title: Embedded Acoustic Intelligence for Automotive Systems
description: "arXiv:2506.11071v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Transforming sound\
  \ insights into actionable streams of data, this abstract leverages findings from\
  \ degree thesis research to enhance automotive system intelligence, enabling us\
  \ to address road type [1].By extracting and interpreting acoustic signatures from\
  \ microphones installed within the wheelbase of a car, we focus on classifying road\
  \ type.Utilizing deep neural networks and feature extraction powered by pre-trained\
  \ models from the Open AI ecosystem (via Hugging Face [2]), our approach enables\
  \ Autonomous Driving and Advanced Driver- Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) to anticipate\
  \ road surfaces, support adaptive learning for active road noise cancellation, and\
  \ generate valuable insights for urban planning. The results of this study were\
  \ specifically captured to support a compelling business case for next-generation\
  \ automotive systems. This forward-looking approach not only promises to redefine\
  \ passenger comfort and improve vehicle safety, but also paves the way for intelligent,\
  \ data-driven urban road management, making the future of mobility both achievable\
  \ and sustainable."
