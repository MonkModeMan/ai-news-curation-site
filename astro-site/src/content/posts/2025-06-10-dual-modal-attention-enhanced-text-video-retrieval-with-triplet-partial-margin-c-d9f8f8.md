title: Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Text-Video Retrieval with Triplet Partial Margin
  Contrastive Learning
description: "arXiv:2309.11082v3 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In recent years,\
  \ the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval increasingly essential\
  \ and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and search. Text-video retrieval\
  \ aims to rank relevant text/video higher than irrelevant ones. The core of this\
  \ task is to precisely measure the cross-modal similarity between texts and videos.\
  \ Recently, contrastive learning methods have shown promising results for text-video\
  \ retrieval, most of which focus on the construction of positive and negative pairs\
  \ to learn text and video representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough\
  \ attention to hard negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels\
  \ of semantic similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive\
  \ learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust\
  \ discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module\
  \ (DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further introducing\
  \ a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively identify all\
  \ these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the training loss.\
  \ Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model fine-grained semantic\
  \ similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby present a new Triplet Partial\
  \ Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to construct partial order triplet\
  \ samples by automatically generating fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video\
  \ pairs. The proposed TPM-CL designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal\
  \ interaction to model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate\
