title: Real-World Deployment of a Lane Change Prediction Architecture Based on Knowledge
  Graph Embeddings and Bayesian Inference
description: "arXiv:2506.11925v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Research on lane\
  \ change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last couple of years. However,\
  \ most research is confined to simulation or results obtained from datasets, leaving\
  \ a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment. This work closes that\
  \ gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a lane-change prediction system based\
  \ on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle\
  \ employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and\
  \ the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception\
  \ module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts\
  \ them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module;\
  \ (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference\
  \ model to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction\
  \ into longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation\
  \ demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane\
  \ change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient\
  \ time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely."
