title: Revealing Political Bias in LLMs through Structured Multi-Agent Debate
description: "arXiv:2506.11825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models\

  \ LLM agents in debates on politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary\
  \ the underlying LLMs, agent genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance\
  \ and agent personas influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates.\
  \ We find that Neutral agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans\
  \ shift closer to the Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting\
  \ their opinions when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research,\
