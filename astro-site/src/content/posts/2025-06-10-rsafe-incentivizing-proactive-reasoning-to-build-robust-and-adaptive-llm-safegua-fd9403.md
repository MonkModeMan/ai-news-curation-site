title: 'RSafe: Incentivizing proactive reasoning to build robust and adaptive LLM
  safeguards'
description: "arXiv:2506.07736v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models\
  \ (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite deliberate safety alignment\
  \ efforts, posing significant risks to users and society. To safeguard against the\
  \ risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed\
  \ to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged\
  \ as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models\
  \ rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution\
  \ threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address\
  \ these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that\
  \ conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope\
  \ of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning,\
  \ where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step\
  \ reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning\
  \ paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm\
  \ enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection\
  \ capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference,\
  \ RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored\
  \ to specific safety requirements."
