title: 'Beyond Formal Semantics for Capabilities and Skills: Model Context Protocol
  in Manufacturing'
description: "arXiv:2506.11180v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Explicit modeling\
  \ of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies, Asset Administration\
  \ Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable manual effort and often\
  \ results in representations that are not easily accessible to Large Language Models\
  \ (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we present an alternative approach based\
  \ on the recently introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to\
  \ expose functionality through a standardized interface that is directly consumable\
  \ by LLM-based agents. We conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale\
  \ manufacturing system, where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose\
  \ LLM is then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including\
  \ constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The results\
  \ indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial automation without\
  \ relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the basis for further exploration\
  \ of external tool integration in LLM-driven production systems."

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies, Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs).

MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system, where resource functions are made available via MCP.
