title: 'MEDDxAgent: A Unified Modular Agent Framework for Explainable Automatic Differential
  Diagnosis'
description: "arXiv:2502.19175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Differential\
  \ Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making,\
  \ in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based\
  \ on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large\
  \ language models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches\
  \ face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization\
  \ of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt\
  \ diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework\
  \ designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative\
  \ learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent\
  \ integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history\
  \ taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis\
  \ strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark\
  \ covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic\
  \ approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient\
  \ profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that\
  \ MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both\
  \ large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic\
  \ reasoning process."
