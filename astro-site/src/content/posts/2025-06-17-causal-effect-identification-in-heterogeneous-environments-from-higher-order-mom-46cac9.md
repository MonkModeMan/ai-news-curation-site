title: Causal Effect Identification in Heterogeneous Environments from Higher-Order
  Moments
description: "arXiv:2506.11756v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We investigate the\
  \ estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on an outcome in the presence\
  \ of a latent confounder. We first show that the causal effect is identifiable under\
  \ certain conditions when data is available from multiple environments, provided\
  \ that the target causal effect remains invariant across these environments. Secondly,\
  \ we propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as\
  \ only a single parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments\
  \ -- whether it be the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between\
  \ two variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous\
  \ noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across environments.\
  \ Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of the data-generating\
  \ mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate the performance of our\
  \ proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data."

We first show that the causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.
