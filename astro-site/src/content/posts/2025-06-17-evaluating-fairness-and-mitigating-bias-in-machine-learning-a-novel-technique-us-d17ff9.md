title: 'Evaluating Fairness and Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning: A Novel Technique
  using Tensor Data and Bayesian Regression'
description: "arXiv:2506.11627v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Fairness is a critical\
  \ component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus on Machine Learning (ML)\
  \ and the performance of model predictions when dealing with skin color. Unlike\
  \ other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color differs significantly. In\
