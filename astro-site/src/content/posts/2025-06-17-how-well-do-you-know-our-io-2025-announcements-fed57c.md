You’re an I/O pro. Originally, the name I/O was based on the first two digits in a googol (a one, followed by 100 zeroes), the number that lends our company its name. According to lore, I/O has evolved to also nod to “input / output,” referencing the computational concept of interfacing between a computer system and the outside world, and “innovation in the open.” Pretty fitting, don’t you think?
