title: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical
  Tables
description: "arXiv:2506.11375v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Chemical tables encode\
  \ complex experimental knowledge through symbolic expressions, structured variables,\
  \ and embedded molecular graphics. Existing benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal\
  \ and domain-specific complexity, limiting the ability of multimodal large language\
  \ models to support scientific understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce\
  \ ChemTable, a large-scale benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from\
  \ the experimental sections of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell\
  \ polygons, logical layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts,\
  \ yields, and graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,\
  \ covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,\
  \ encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering grounded\
  \ in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of representative\
  \ multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source models, on ChemTable\
  \ and reported a series of findings with practical and conceptual insights. Although\
  \ models show reasonable performance on basic layout parsing, they exhibit substantial\
  \ limitations on both descriptive and inferential QA tasks compared to human performance,\
  \ and we observe significant performance gaps between open-source and closed-source\
  \ models across multiple dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of\
  \ chemistry-aware table understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic\
  \ benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning."
