title: Adaptive Composition of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) for IoT Environments
description: "arXiv:2506.11054v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The dynamic nature\
  \ of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the long-term effectiveness\
  \ of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions. The uncertainty and variability\
  \ of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in data distribution, e.g., concept drift\
  \ and data heterogeneity, and evolving system requirements, e.g., scalability demands\
  \ and resource limitations. This paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework\
  \ to ensure a seamless, efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework\
  \ integrates a service assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services\
  \ and a candidate selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition\
  \ mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a contextual\

  \ IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS) while reducing\

  \ results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach."

The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless, efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS) while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.
