title: 'PiPViT: Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes for Retinal Image Analysis'
description: "arXiv:2506.10669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Background\
  \ and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by learning fine-grained\
  \ part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the input pixel space is not\
  \ always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers. In addition, well-known\
  \ prototype-based approaches typically learn extremely granular prototypes that\
  \ are less interpretable in medical imaging, where both the presence and extent\
  \ of biomarkers and lesions are critical.\n  Methods: To address these challenges,\
  \ we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently\
  \ interpretable prototypical model for image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer\
  \ (ViT), PiPViT captures long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust,\
  \ human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level\
  \ labels. Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution\
  \ input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across scales.\n\
  \  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four\
  \ datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art\
  \ methods while delivering more meaningful explanations. Moreover, quantitative\
  \ evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the learned prototypes are semantically\
  \ and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions\
  \ and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT"
