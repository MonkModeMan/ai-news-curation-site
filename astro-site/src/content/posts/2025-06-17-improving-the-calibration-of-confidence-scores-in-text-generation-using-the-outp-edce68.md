title: Improving the Calibration of Confidence Scores in Text Generation Using the
  Output Distribution's Characteristics
description: "arXiv:2506.00637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Well-calibrated\
  \ model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models.\
  \ For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores,\
  \ to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However,\
  \ confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason\
  \ is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods\
  \ do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output\
  \ probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic\
  \ confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities\
  \ associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or\
  \ heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5\
  \ on summarization, translation, and QA datasets."
