title: Long-Tailed Learning for Generalized Category Discovery
description: "arXiv:2506.06965v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generalized Category\
  \ Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known classes to discover novel classes\
  \ in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show effective performance on artificial\
  \ datasets with balanced distributions. However, real-world datasets are always\

  \ to derive discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this\
  \ process encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments\
