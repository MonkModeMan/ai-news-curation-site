title: 'Gradients: When Markets Meet Fine-tuning -- A Distributed Approach to Model
  Optimisation'
description: "arXiv:2506.07940v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Foundation model fine-tuning\
  \ faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML platforms rely on single optimisation\
  \ strategies that explore only a fraction of viable hyperparameter configurations.\
  \ In this white paper, We introduce Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that\
  \ transforms hyperparameter optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent\
  \ miners compete to discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual\
  \ exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic investigation\
  \ of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We evaluate our approach\
  \ across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model architectures (70M to\
  \ 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an 82.8\\% win rate against\
  \ HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\\% against TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud,\
  \ with mean improvements of 11.8\\% and 42.1\\% respectively. Complex reasoning\
  \ and retrieval tasks show particularly strong gains of 30-40\\%, whilst diffusion\
  \ models achieve 23.4\\% improvements for person-specific generation. These results\
  \ demonstrate that competitive, economically-driven approaches can systematically\
  \ discover superior configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss."

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an 82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\% respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive, economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.
