title: Multimodal Modeling of CRISPR-Cas12 Activity Using Foundation Models and Chromatin
  Accessibility Data
description: "arXiv:2506.11182v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Predicting guide\
  \ RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12 genome editing but\
  \ remains challenging due to limited data, variation across protospacer adjacent\
  \ motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding), and reliance on large-scale\
  \ training. We investigate whether pre-trained biological foundation model originally\
  \ trained on transcriptomic data can improve gRNA activity estimation even without\
  \ domain-specific pre-training. Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model\
  \ as input to lightweight regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional\
  \ baselines. We also integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory\
  \ context, improving performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness\
  \ of pre-trained foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity\
  \ prediction."
