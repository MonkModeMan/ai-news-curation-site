title: Are LLMs Good Text Diacritizers? An Arabic and Yor\`ub\'a Case Study
description: "arXiv:2506.11602v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We investigate the\
  \ effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text diacritization in two typologically\
  \ distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce\
  \ a novel multilingual dataset MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range\
  \ of diacritic ambiguities. We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility,\
  \ and language coverage, and benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization\
  \ models. Additionally, we fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for\
  \ Yoruba. Our results show that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization\
  \ models for both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.\
  \ Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and\
  \ reduce hallucination rates."
