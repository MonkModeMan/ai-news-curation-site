title: 'LLMEval-Med: A Real-world Clinical Benchmark for Medical LLMs with Physician
  Validation'
description: "arXiv:2506.04078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Evaluating\
  \ large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications\
  \ require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have\
  \ three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments.\
  \ However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice),\
  \ data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation\
  \ methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present\
  \ LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996\
  \ questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed\
  \ clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating\
  \ expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our\
  \ methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis,\
  \ dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure\
  \ reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical\
  \ models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing\
  \ valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains.\
  \ The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med."
