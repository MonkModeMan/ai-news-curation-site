Course Launch Community Event
We are excited to share that after a lot of work from the Hugging Face team, part 2 of the Hugging Face Course will be released on November 15th! Part 1 focused on teaching you how to use a pretrained model, fine-tune it on a text classification task then upload the result to the Model Hub. Part 2 will focus on all the other common NLP tasks: token classification, language modeling (causal and masked), translation, summarization and question answering. It will also take a deeper dive in the whole Hugging Face ecosystem, in particular ü§ó Datasets and ü§ó Tokenizers.
To go with this release, we are organizing a large community event to which you are invited! The program includes two days of talks, then team projects focused on fine-tuning a model on any NLP task ending with live demos like this one. Those demos will go nicely in your portfolio if you are looking for a new job in Machine Learning. We will also deliver a certificate of completion to all the participants that achieve building one of them.
AWS is sponsoring this event by offering free compute to participants via Amazon SageMaker.
To register, please fill out this form. You will find below more details on the two days of talks.
Day 1 (November 15th): A high-level view of Transformers and how to train them
The first day of talks will focus on a high-level presentation of Transformers models and the tools we can use to train or fine-tune them.
Thomas Wolf: Transfer Learning and the birth of the Transformers library
Thomas Wolf is co-founder and Chief Science Officer of HuggingFace. The tools created by Thomas Wolf and the Hugging Face team are used across more than 5,000 research organisations including Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research, Google Research, DeepMind, Amazon Research, Apple, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence as well as most university departments. Thomas Wolf is the initiator and senior chair of the largest research collaboration that has ever existed in Artificial Intelligence: ‚ÄúBigScience‚Äù, as well as a set of widely used libraries and tools. Thomas Wolf is also a prolific educator and a thought leader in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, a regular invited speaker to conferences all around the world (https://thomwolf.io).
Margaret Mitchell: On Values in ML Development
Margaret Mitchell is a researcher working on Ethical AI, currently focused on the ins and outs of ethics-informed AI development in tech. She has published over 50 papers on natural language generation, assistive technology, computer vision, and AI ethics, and holds multiple patents in the areas of conversation generation and sentiment classification. She previously worked at Google AI as a Staff Research Scientist, where she founded and co-led Google's Ethical AI group, focused on foundational AI ethics research and operationalizing AI ethics Google-internally. Before joining Google, she was a researcher at Microsoft Research, focused on computer vision-to-language generation; and was a postdoc at Johns Hopkins, focused on Bayesian modeling and information extraction. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Aberdeen and a Master's in computational linguistics from the University of Washington. While earning her degrees, she also worked from 2005-2012 on machine learning, neurological disorders, and assistive technology at Oregon Health and Science University. She has spearheaded a number of workshops and initiatives at the intersections of diversity, inclusion, computer science, and ethics. Her work has received awards from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and the American Foundation for the Blind, and has been implemented by multiple technology companies. She likes gardening, dogs, and cats.
Jakob Uszkoreit: It Ain't Broke So Don't Fix Let's Break It
Jakob Uszkoreit is the co-founder of Inceptive. Inceptive designs RNA molecules for vaccines and therapeutics using large-scale deep learning in a tight loop with high throughput experiments with the goal of making RNA-based medicines more accessible, more effective and more broadly applicable. Previously, Jakob worked at Google for more than a decade, leading research and development teams in Google Brain, Research and Search working on deep learning fundamentals, computer vision, language understanding and machine translation.
