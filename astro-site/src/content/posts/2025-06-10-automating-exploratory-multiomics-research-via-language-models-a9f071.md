title: Automating Exploratory Multiomics Research via Language Models
description: "arXiv:2506.07591v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces\
  \ PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces data-driven hypotheses from raw\
  \ data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical proteogenomics, a field where effective\
  \ downstream data analysis and hypothesis proposal is crucial for producing novel\
  \ discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate modules to simulate different stages of the\
  \ scientific process, from open-ended data exploration to specific statistical analysis\
  \ and hypothesis proposal. It formulates research directions, tools, and results\
  \ in terms of relationships between biological entities, using unified graph structures\
  \ to manage complex research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics\
  \ datasets from published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were\
  \ evaluated through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through\
  \ exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and\
  \ heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability\
  \ and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents\
  \ a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific\
  \ domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data."
