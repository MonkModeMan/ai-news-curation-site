title: Intelligibility of Text-to-Speech Systems for Mathematical Expressions
description: "arXiv:2506.11086v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: There has been limited\
  \ evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models with Mathematical eXpressions\
  \ (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility\
  \ of five TTS models through listening and transcribing tests for various categories\
  \ of MX. We use two Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation\
  \ from LaTeX MX as TTS models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion\
  \ Score from user ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness\
  \ using three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect\
  \ to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS models\
  \ for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility varies across\
  \ TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of TTS models is\
  \ significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of choice of LLM\
  \ is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for MX."
