title: Complexity of normalized stochastic first-order methods with momentum under
  heavy-tailed noise
description: "arXiv:2506.11214v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In this paper, we\
  \ propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods with Polyak momentum,\
  \ multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for solving unconstrained\
  \ optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters\
  \ and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as\
  \ the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity\
  \ results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed\
  \ noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than\
  \ the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our\
  \ complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.\
  \ Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness\
  \ of the proposed methods."
