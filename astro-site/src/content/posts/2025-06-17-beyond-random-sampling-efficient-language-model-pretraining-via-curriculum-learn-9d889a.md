Title:Beyond Random Sampling: Efficient Language Model Pretraining via Curriculum Learning
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development under realistic training scenarios.
