title: Benchmarking Misuse Mitigation Against Covert Adversaries
description: "arXiv:2506.06414v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Existing language\
  \ model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and low-stakes tasks. Realistic\
  \ attackers can subvert current safeguards by requesting help on small, benign-seeming\
  \ tasks across many independent queries. Because individual queries do not appear\
  \ harmful, the attack is hard to {detect}. However, when combined, these fragments\
  \ uplift misuse by helping the attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward\
  \ identifying defenses against such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful\
  \ Defenses (BSD), a data generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert\
  \ attacks and corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets\
  \ that are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker\
  \ open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are effective\
  \ misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure."
