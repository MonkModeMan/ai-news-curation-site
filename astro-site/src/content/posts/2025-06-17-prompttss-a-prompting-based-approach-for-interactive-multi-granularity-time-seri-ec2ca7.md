title: 'PromptTSS: A Prompting-Based Approach for Interactive Multi-Granularity Time
  Series Segmentation'
description: "arXiv:2506.11170v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Multivariate time\
  \ series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable\
  \ technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained\
  \ system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and\
  \ integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like\
  \ predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series\
  \ segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple\
  \ levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to\
  \ new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we\
  \ propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity\
  \ states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages\
  \ label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and\
  \ fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments\
  \ show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation,\
  \ 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning,\
  \ demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series\
  \ dynamics."
