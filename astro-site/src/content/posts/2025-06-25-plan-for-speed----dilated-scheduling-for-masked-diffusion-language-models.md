title: "Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models"
description: "arXiv:2506.19037v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores. Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs."
