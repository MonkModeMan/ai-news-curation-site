title: Noise Consistency Regularization for Improved Subject-Driven Image Synthesis

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However, existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity.
