title: 'Impact of Frame Rates on Speech Tokenizer: A Case Study on Mandarin and English'
description: "arXiv:2505.17076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The speech\
  \ tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a\
  \ bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs\
  \ are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech\
  \ tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame\
  \ rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically\
  \ distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the\
  \ resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal\
  \ that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each\
  \ language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and\
  \ language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing\
  \ frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech\
  \ recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications."
