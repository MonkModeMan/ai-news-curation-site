title: "CLIP-MG: Guiding Semantic Attention with Skeletal Pose Features and RGB Data for Micro-Gesture Recognition on the iMiGUE Dataset"
description: "arXiv:2506.16385v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture recognition."
