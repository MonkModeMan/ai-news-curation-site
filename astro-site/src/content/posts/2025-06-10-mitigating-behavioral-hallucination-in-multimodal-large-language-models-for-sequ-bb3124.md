title: Mitigating Behavioral Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models for
  Sequential Images
description: "arXiv:2506.07184v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While multimodal large\
  \ language models excel at various tasks, they still suffer from hallucinations,\
  \ which limit their reliability and scalability for broader domain applications.\
  \ To address this issue, recent research mainly focuses on objective hallucination.\
  \ However, for sequential images, besides objective hallucination, there is also\
  \ behavioral hallucination, which is less studied. This work aims to fill in the\
  \ gap. We first reveal that behavioral hallucinations mainly arise from two key\
  \ factors: prior-driven bias and the snowball effect. Based on these observations,\
  \ we introduce SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage\
  \ framework that (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using\
  \ our proposed adaptive temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection\
  \ onto the joint embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify\
  \ behavioral hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate\
  \ that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while maintaining\
  \ descriptive accuracy."
