View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets. Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and answer relevancy.

These findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components across different document types.
