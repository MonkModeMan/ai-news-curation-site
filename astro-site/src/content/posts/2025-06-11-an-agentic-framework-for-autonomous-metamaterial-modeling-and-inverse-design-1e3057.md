title: An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Metamaterial Modeling and Inverse Design
description: "arXiv:2506.06935v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent significant\
  \ advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) systems have enabled\
  \ Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, including\
  \ novel scientific research. We develop and demonstrate such a framework specifically\
  \ for the inverse design of photonic metamaterials. When queried with a desired\
  \ optical spectrum, the Agent autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep\
  \ learning model, accesses external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and\
  \ optimization, utilizes memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse\
  \ method. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate,\
  \ reason, plan, and adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection\
  \ and decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs."
