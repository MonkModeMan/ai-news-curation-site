title: Ad Auctions for LLMs via Retrieval Augmented Generation
description: "arXiv:2406.09459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In the field\
  \ of computational advertising, the integration of ads into the outputs of large\
  \ language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to support these services without\
  \ compromising content integrity. This paper introduces novel auction mechanisms\
  \ for ad allocation and pricing within the textual outputs of LLMs, leveraging retrieval-augmented\
  \ generation (RAG). We propose a segment auction where an ad is probabilistically\
  \ retrieved for each discourse segment (paragraph, section, or entire output) according\
  \ to its bid and relevance, following the RAG framework, and priced according to\
  \ competing bids. We show that our auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare,\
  \ a new notion of welfare that balances allocation efficiency and fairness, and\
  \ we characterize the associated incentive-compatible pricing rule. These results\
  \ are extended to multi-ad allocation per segment. An empirical evaluation validates\
  \ the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach over several ad auction scenarios,\
  \ and exhibits inherent tradeoffs in metrics as we allow the LLM more flexibility\
  \ to allocate ads."
