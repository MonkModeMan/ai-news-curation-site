title: "GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing"
description: "arXiv:2506.19224v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However, they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to become a standard graph data preprocessing method."
