description: "arXiv:2506.11017v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The rapid advancement\
  \ of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled progress in artificial\
  \ intelligence, demonstrating substantial application potential across multiple\
  \ specialized domains. Telecommunications operation scheduling (OS) is a critical\
  \ aspect of the telecommunications industry, involving the coordinated management\

Telecommunications operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks, and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified service control.
