title: 'A$^2$LC: Active and Automated Label Correction for Semantic Segmentation'

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
