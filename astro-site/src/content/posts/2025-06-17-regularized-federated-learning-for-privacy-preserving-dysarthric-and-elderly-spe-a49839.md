title: Regularized Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Dysarthric and Elderly
  Speech Recognition
description: "arXiv:2506.11069v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accurate recognition\
  \ of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to date. While privacy concerns\
  \ have driven a shift from centralized approaches to federated learning (FL) to\
  \ ensure data confidentiality, this further exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity,\
  \ imbalanced data distribution and speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper\
  \ conducts a systematic investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving\

  \ Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly\
  \ speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems consistently outperform the\
