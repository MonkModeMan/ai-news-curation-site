title: 'KokushiMD-10: Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Ten Japanese
  National Healthcare Licensing Examinations'
description: "arXiv:2506.11114v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances\
  \ in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable performance in medical\
  \ licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across various healthcare\
  \ roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing\
  \ benchmarks are typically text-based, English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines,\
  \ which limits their ability to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal\
  \ reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal\
  \ benchmark constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This\
  \ benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy,\
  \ and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam questions, incorporating\
  \ clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to evaluate both textual and visual\
  \ reasoning. We benchmark over 30 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude\
  \ 3.5, and Gemini, across both text and image-based settings. Despite promising\
  \ results, no model consistently meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting\
  \ the ongoing challenges in medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and\
  \ linguistically grounded resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric\
  \ medical AI across multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks."
