title: Saturation Self-Organizing Map
description: "arXiv:2506.10680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Continual\
  \ learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which often suffer\
  \ from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks. Self-Organizing\
  \ Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are not immune to\
  \ this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an\
  \ extension of SOMs designed to improve knowledge retention in continual learning\
  \ scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces\
  \ the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information.\
  \ This effectively freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized\
  \ areas of the map."
