title: A Self-Refining Framework for Enhancing ASR Using TTS-Synthesized Data
description: "arXiv:2506.11130v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We propose a self-refining\
  \ framework that enhances ASR performance with only unlabeled datasets. The process\
  \ starts with an existing ASR model generating pseudo-labels on unannotated speech,\
  \ which are then used to train a high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then,\
  \ synthesized speech text pairs are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing\
  \ the closed-loop self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the\
  \ framework on Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech,\
  \ a moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we adapt\
  \ Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error rates\
  \ by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks\
  \ compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling alternative\
  \ to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a practical pathway\
  \ for improving ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings."
