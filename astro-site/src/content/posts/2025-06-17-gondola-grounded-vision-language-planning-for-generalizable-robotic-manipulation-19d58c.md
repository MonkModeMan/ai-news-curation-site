title: 'Gondola: Grounded Vision Language Planning for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation'
description: "arXiv:2506.11261v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Robotic manipulation\
  \ faces a significant challenge in generalizing across unseen objects, environments\
  \ and tasks specified by diverse language instructions. To improve generalization\
  \ capabilities, recent research has incorporated large language models (LLMs) for\
  \ planning and action execution. While promising, these methods often fall short\
  \ in generating grounded plans in visual environments. Although efforts have been\
  \ made to perform visual instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation,\
  \ existing methods are typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle\
  \ with precise object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded\
  \ vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic manipulation.\
  \ Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the next action plan\
  \ with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target objects and locations.\
  \ To support the training of Gondola, we construct three types of datasets using\
  \ the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning, multi-view referring expression\
  \ and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola outperforms the state-of-the-art\
  \ LLM-based method across all four generalization levels of the GemBench dataset,\
  \ including novel placements, rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon\
  \ tasks."
