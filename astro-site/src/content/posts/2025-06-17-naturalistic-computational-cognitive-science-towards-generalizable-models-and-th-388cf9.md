title: 'Naturalistic Computational Cognitive Science: Towards generalizable models
  and theories that capture the full range of natural behavior'
description: "arXiv:2502.20349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: How can\
  \ cognitive science build generalizable theories that span the full scope of natural\
  \ situations and behaviors? We argue that progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI)\
  \ offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with\
  \ increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models\
  \ that can accommodate these changes. We first review a growing body of research\
  \ spanning neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI that suggests that incorporating\
  \ a broader range of naturalistic experimental paradigms, and models that accommodate\
  \ them, may be necessary to resolve some aspects of natural intelligence and ensure\
  \ that our theories generalize. First, we review cases from cognitive science and\
  \ neuroscience where naturalistic paradigms elicit distinct behaviors or engage\
  \ different processes. We then discuss recent progress in AI that shows that learning\
  \ from naturalistic data yields qualitatively different patterns of behavior and\
  \ generalization, and discuss how these findings impact the conclusions we draw\
  \ from cognitive modeling, and can help yield new hypotheses for the roots of cognitive\
  \ and neural phenomena. We then suggest that integrating recent progress in AI and\
  \ cognitive science will enable us to engage with more naturalistic phenomena without\
  \ giving up experimental control or the pursuit of theoretically grounded understanding.\
  \ We offer practical guidance on how methodological practices can contribute to\
  \ cumulative progress in naturalistic computational cognitive science, and illustrate\
  \ a path towards building computational models that solve the real problems of natural\
  \ cognition, together with a reductive understanding of the processes and principles\
  \ by which they do so."

We argue that progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models that can accommodate these changes.
