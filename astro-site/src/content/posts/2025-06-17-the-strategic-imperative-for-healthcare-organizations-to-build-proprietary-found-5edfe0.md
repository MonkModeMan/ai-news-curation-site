title: The Strategic Imperative for Healthcare Organizations to Build Proprietary
  Foundation Models
description: "arXiv:2506.11412v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper presents\
  \ a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for healthcare organizations\
  \ to develop proprietary foundation models rather than relying exclusively on commercial\
  \ alternatives. We examine four fundamental considerations driving this imperative:\
  \ the domain-specific requirements of healthcare data representation, critical data\
  \ sovereignty and governance considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive\
  \ advantages afforded by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential\
  \ of healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational operations.\
  \ Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and organizational\
  \ case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal foundation models enable\
  \ healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical performance, maintain robust\
  \ data governance, create sustainable competitive advantages, and accelerate innovation\
  \ pathways. While acknowledging implementation challenges, we present evidence showing\
  \ organizations with proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved\
  \ outcomes, faster innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the\
  \ evolving healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with\
  \ a comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding\
  \ foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model development\
  \ as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare organizations."
