title: Model-based Neural Data Augmentation for sub-wavelength Radio Localization
description: "arXiv:2506.06387v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The increasing deployment\
  \ of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial\
  \ resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional\
  \ signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly\
  \ in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting\
  \ in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have\
  \ facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques,\
  \ enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these\
  \ methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training\
  \ and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based\
  \ localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and\
  \ improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to\
  \ learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural\
  \ channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary\
  \ while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting\
  \ baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in NLoS environments.\
  \ Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization\
  \ accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude\
  \ compared to classical fingerprinting methods."
