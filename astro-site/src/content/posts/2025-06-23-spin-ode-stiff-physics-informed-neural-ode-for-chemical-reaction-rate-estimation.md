title: "SPIN-ODE: Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE for Chemical Reaction Rate Estimation"
description: "arXiv:2505.05625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Estimating rate coefficients from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate coefficient estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry."
