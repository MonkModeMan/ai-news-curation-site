title: 'FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving'
description: "arXiv:2506.11419v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In end-to-end autonomous\
  \ driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role in ego-vehicle planning. However,\
  \ existing methods often rely on globally aggregated motion features, ignoring the\
