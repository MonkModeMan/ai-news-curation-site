title: 'LaMP-Cap: Personalized Figure Caption Generation With Multimodal Figure Profiles'
description: "arXiv:2506.06561v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Figure captions\
  \ are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message.\
  \ Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose\
  \ better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise\
  \ generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style,\
  \ highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization\
  \ (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely\
  \ address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces\
  \ LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal\
  \ figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed\
  \ inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same\
  \ document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a\
  \ profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using\
  \ profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original\
  \ author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more\
  \ helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using\
  \ multimodal profiles over text-only ones."

Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily.
