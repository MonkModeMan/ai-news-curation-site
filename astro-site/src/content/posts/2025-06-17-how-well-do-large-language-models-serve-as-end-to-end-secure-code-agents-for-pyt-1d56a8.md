title: How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for
  Python?
description: "arXiv:2408.10495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The rapid\
  \ advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the\
  \ landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern\
  \ development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary\
  \ and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the\
  \ code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure\
  \ code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent\
  \ potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied\
  \ GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code\
  \ generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama,\
  \ and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our\
  \ study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant\
  \ security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the\
  \ SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely\
  \ identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can\
  \ achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the\
  \ 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating\
  \ self-repair \"blind spots\". To address the limitation of a single round of repair,\
  \ we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code\
  \ through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study.\
  \ Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly\
  \ improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%."
