title: "Conversational Intent-Driven GraphRAG: Enhancing Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems through Adaptive Dual-Retrieval of Flow Patterns and Context Semantics"
description: "arXiv:2506.19385v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn dialogues."
