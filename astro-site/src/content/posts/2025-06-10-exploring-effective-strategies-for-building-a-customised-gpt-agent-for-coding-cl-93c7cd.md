title: Exploring Effective Strategies for Building a Customised GPT Agent for Coding
  Classroom Dialogues
description: "arXiv:2506.07194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates\
  \ effective strategies for developing a customised GPT agent to code classroom dialogue.\
  \ While classroom dialogue is widely recognised as a crucial element of education,\
  \ its analysis remains challenging due to the need for a nuanced understanding of\
  \ dialogic functions and the labour-intensive nature of manual transcript coding.\
  \ Recent advancements in large language models offer promising avenues for automating\
  \ this process. However, existing studies predominantly focus on training large-scale\
  \ models or evaluating pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often\
  \ not applicable or replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets\
  \ or customised coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study\
  \ evaluates its baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook\
  \ and examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a variable\
  \ control method. Through a design-based research approach, it identifies a set\
  \ of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for configuring effective\
  \ agents with limited data. The findings suggest that, despite some limitations,\
  \ a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can serve as a useful coding assistant\
  \ by generating coding suggestions."
