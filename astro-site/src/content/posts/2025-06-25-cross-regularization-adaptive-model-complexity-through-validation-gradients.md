title: "Cross-regularization: Adaptive Model Complexity through Validation Gradients"
description: "arXiv:2506.19755v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple gradient-based approach."
