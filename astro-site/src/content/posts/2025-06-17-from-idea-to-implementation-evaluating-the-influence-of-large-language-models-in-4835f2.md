title: 'From Idea to Implementation: Evaluating the Influence of Large Language Models
  in Software Development -- An Opinion Paper'
description: "arXiv:2503.07450v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The introduction\
  \ of transformer architecture was a turning point in Natural Language Processing\
  \ (NLP). Models based on the transformer architecture such as Bidirectional Encoder\
  \ Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformer\
  \ (GPT) have gained widespread popularity in various applications such as software\
  \ development and education. The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such\
  \ as ChatGPT and Bard to the general public has showcased the tremendous potential\
  \ of these models and encouraged their integration into various domains such as\
  \ software development for tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation\
  \ generation. In this study, opinions from 11 experts regarding their experience\
  \ with LLMs for software development have been gathered and analysed to draw insights\
  \ that can guide successful and responsible integration. The overall opinion of\
  \ the experts is positive, with the experts identifying advantages such as increase\
  \ in productivity and reduced coding time. Potential concerns and challenges such\
  \ as risk of over-dependence and ethical considerations have also been highlighted."
