title: 'FAA Framework: A Large Language Model-Based Approach for Credit Card Fraud
  Investigations'
description: "arXiv:2506.11635v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The continuous growth\
  \ of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who exploit stolen credit card\
  \ details. Companies often investigate suspicious transactions in order to retain\
  \ customer trust and address gaps in their fraud detection systems. However, analysts\
  \ are overwhelmed with an enormous number of alerts from credit card transaction\
  \ monitoring systems. Each alert investigation requires from the fraud analysts\
  \ careful attention, specialized knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes,\
  \ leading to alert fatigue. To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant\
  \ (FAA) framework, which employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate\
  \ credit card fraud investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework\
  \ leverages the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct\
  \ planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A comprehensive\
  \ empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations demonstrates that\
  \ the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient investigations comprising seven\
  \ steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA framework can automate large parts\
  \ of the workload and help reduce the challenges faced by fraud analysts."

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue. To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the challenges faced by fraud analysts.
