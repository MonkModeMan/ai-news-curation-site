title: 'HAIBU-ReMUD: Reasoning Multimodal Ultrasound Dataset and Model Bridging to
  General Specific Domains'
description: "arXiv:2506.07837v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal large language\
  \ models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in general domains but perform poorly\
  \ in some specific domains due to a lack of domain-specific data, such as image-text\
  \ data or vedio-text data. In some specific domains, there is abundant graphic and\
  \ textual data scattered around, but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field\
  \ of medical ultrasound, there are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical\
  \ guidelines, ultrasonic diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic\
  \ materials are often saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly\
  \ used for the training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning\
  \ supervised fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets\
  \ (image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials.\
  \ A medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000\
  \ reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and\
  \ Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct,\

Title:HAIBU-ReMUD: Reasoning Multimodal Ultrasound Dataset and Model Bridging to General Specific Domains
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around, but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets (image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000 reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound field.
