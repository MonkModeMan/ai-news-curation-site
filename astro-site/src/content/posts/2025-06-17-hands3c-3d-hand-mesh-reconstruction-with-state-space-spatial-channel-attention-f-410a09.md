title: 'HandS3C: 3D Hand Mesh Reconstruction with State Space Spatial Channel Attention
  from RGB images'
description: "arXiv:2405.01066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Reconstructing\
  \ the hand mesh from one single RGB image is a challenging task because hands are\
  \ often occluded by other objects. Most previous works attempt to explore more additional\
  \ information and adopt attention mechanisms for improving 3D reconstruction performance,\
  \ while it would increase computational complexity simultaneously. To achieve a\
  \ performance-reserving architecture with high computational efficiency, in this\
  \ work, we propose a simple but effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network (i.e.,\
  \ HandS3C), which is the first time to incorporate state space model into the task\
  \ of hand mesh reconstruction. In the network, we design a novel state-space spatial-channel\
  \ attention module that extends the effective receptive field, extracts hand features\
  \ in the spatial dimension, and enhances regional features of hands in the channel\
  \ dimension. This helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive\
  \ experiments conducted on well-known datasets facing heavy occlusions (such as\
  \ FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandS3C achieves state-of-the-art\
  \ performance while maintaining a minimal parameters."
