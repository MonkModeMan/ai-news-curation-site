title: Prioritizing Alignment Paradigms over Task-Specific Model Customization in
  Time-Series LLMs
description: "arXiv:2506.11512v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances\
  \ in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented capabilities for time-series\
  \ reasoning in diverse real-world applications, including medical, financial, and\
  \ spatio-temporal domains. However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific\
  \ model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking\
  \ the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for\
  \ in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching\
  \ time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in\
  \ the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization.\
  \ This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning\
  \ approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically\
  \ accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end,\
  \ we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment,\
  \ and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects\
  \ of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively,\
  \ to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible,\
  \ and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented\
  \ method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.\
