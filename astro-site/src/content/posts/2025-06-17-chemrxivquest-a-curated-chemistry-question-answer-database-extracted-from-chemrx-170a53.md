title: 'ChemRxivQuest: A Curated Chemistry Question-Answer Database Extracted from
  ChemRxiv Preprints'
description: "arXiv:2505.05232v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The rapid expansion\
  \ of chemistry literature poses significant challenges for researchers seeking to\
  \ efficiently access domain-specific knowledge. To support advancements in chemistry-focused\
  \ natural language processing (NLP), we present ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset\
  \ of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs derived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints\
  \ across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source\
  \ text segment to ensure traceability and contextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was\
  \ constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition\
  \ (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification.\
  \ The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions,\
  \ enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development,\
  \ and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's\
  \ structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion\
  \ and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource for chemistry\
  \ NLP research, education, and tool development."
