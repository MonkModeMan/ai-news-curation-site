title: 'LLMs on support of privacy and security of mobile apps: state of the art and
  research directions'
description: "arXiv:2506.11679v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Modern life has\
  \ witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides the valuable features\
  \ that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy risks still threaten\
  \ users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of these threats in recent\

  \ In this chapter, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\

  \ application ecosystem. By introducing state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs\
  \ to mitigate the top 10 common security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight\
  \ the feasibility and potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods,\
  \ such as dynamic and hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example\
  \ of LLM-based solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage\
  \ when users share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays.\
  \ Finally, we discuss open research challenges."

Title:LLMs on support of privacy and security of mobile apps: state of the art and research directions
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally, we discuss open research challenges.
