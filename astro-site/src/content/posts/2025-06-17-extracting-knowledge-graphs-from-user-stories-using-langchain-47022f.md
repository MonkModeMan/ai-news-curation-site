title: Extracting Knowledge Graphs from User Stories using LangChain
description: "arXiv:2506.11020v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This thesis introduces\
  \ a novel methodology for the automated generation of knowledge graphs from user\
  \ stories by leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models. Utilizing\
  \ the LangChain framework as a basis, the User Story Graph Transformer module was\
  \ developed to extract nodes and relationships from user stories using an LLM to\
  \ construct accurate knowledge graphs.This innovative technique was implemented\
  \ in a script to fully automate the knowledge graph extraction process. Additionally,\
  \ the evaluation was automated through a dedicated evaluation script, utilizing\
  \ an annotated dataset for assessment. By enhancing the visualization and understanding\
  \ of user requirements and domain concepts, this method fosters better alignment\
  \ between software functionalities and user expectations, ultimately contributing\
  \ to more effective and user-centric software development processes."
