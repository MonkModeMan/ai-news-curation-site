title: 'Graph of Attacks with Pruning: Optimizing Stealthy Jailbreak Prompt Generation
  for Enhanced LLM Content Moderation'
description: "arXiv:2501.18638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As large\
  \ language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their robustness\
  \ against adversarial misuse is crucial. This paper introduces the GAP (Graph of\
  \ Attacks with Pruning) framework, an advanced approach for generating stealthy\
  \ jailbreak prompts to evaluate and enhance LLM safeguards. GAP addresses limitations\
  \ in existing tree-based LLM jailbreak methods by implementing an interconnected\
  \ graph structure that enables knowledge sharing across attack paths. Our experimental\
  \ evaluation demonstrates GAP's superiority over existing techniques, achieving\
  \ a 20.8% increase in attack success rates while reducing query costs by 62.7%.\
  \ GAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for attacking both open\
  \ and closed LLMs, with attack success rates of >96%. Additionally, we present specialized\
  \ variants like GAP-Auto for automated seed generation and GAP-VLM for multimodal\
  \ attacks. GAP-generated prompts prove highly effective in improving content moderation\
  \ systems, increasing true positive detection rates by 108.5% and accuracy by 183.6%\
  \ when used for fine-tuning. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/dsbuddy/GAP-LLM-Safety."
