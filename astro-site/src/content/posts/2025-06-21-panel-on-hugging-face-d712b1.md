Panel on Hugging Face
We are thrilled to announce the collaboration between Panel and Hugging Face! üéâ We have integrated a Panel template in Hugging Face Spaces to help you get started building Panel apps and deploy them on Hugging Face effortlessly.
What does Panel offer?
Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you easily build powerful tools, dashboards and complex applications entirely in Python. It has a batteries-included philosophy, putting the PyData ecosystem, powerful data tables and much more at your fingertips. High-level reactive APIs and lower-level callback based APIs ensure you can quickly build exploratory applications, but you aren‚Äôt limited if you build complex, multi-page apps with rich interactivity. Panel is a member of the HoloViz ecosystem, your gateway into a connected ecosystem of data exploration tools. Panel, like the other HoloViz tools, is a NumFocus-sponsored project, with support from Anaconda and Blackstone.
Here are some notable features of Panel that our users find valuable.
- Panel provides extensive support for various plotting libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, Bokeh, PyDeck,Vizzu, and more.
- All interactivity works the same in Jupyter and in a standalone deployment. Panel allows seamless integration of components from a Jupyter notebook into a dashboard, enabling smooth transitions between data exploration and sharing results.
- Panel empowers users to build complex multi-page applications, advanced interactive features, visualize large datasets, and stream real-time data.
- Integration with Pyodide and WebAssembly enables seamless execution of Panel applications in web browsers.
