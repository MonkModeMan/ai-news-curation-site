title: Beating Transformers using Synthetic Cognition
description: "arXiv:2504.07619v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The road to Artificial\
  \ General Intelligence goes through the generation of context-aware reactive behaviors,\

  \ classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the\
  \ DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the\

In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors.
