Today, we’re starting to roll out interactive chart visualizations in AI Mode in Labs to help bring financial data to life for questions on stocks and mutual funds.
Now, you can compare and analyze information over a specific time period and get an interactive graph and comprehensive explanation — custom-built for your question.
Ask to “compare the stock performance of blue chip CPG companies in 2024.” Instead of manually researching individual companies and their stock prices, AI Mode does the heavy lifting for you using Gemini’s advanced multi-step reasoning and multimodal capabilities. And ask a follow up like “did any of these companies pay back dividends?” and AI Mode understands what to research for you.
Under the hood, our advanced models understand the intent of the question, tap into real-time and historical information and intelligently determine how to present information to help you make sense of it. Try it out today in Labs!
