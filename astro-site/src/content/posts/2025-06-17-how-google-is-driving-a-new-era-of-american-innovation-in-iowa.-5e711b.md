Google is investing an additional $7 billion in Iowa within the next two years in cloud and AI infrastructure, as well as in expanded workforce development programs, meaningfully increasing the pace of investments the company has made in the state since 2007. The announcement reflects development of both a new data center in Cedar Rapids and expansion of our existing facility in Council Bluffs, as well as providing funding to support an innovative program with the electrical training ALLIANCE (etA) to help increase the electrical workforce pipeline in Iowa by 95%, further powering this next chapter by helping develop the labor force needed to build new energy infrastructure.
Google's investments across the U.S., including in Iowa, are helping enable this extraordinary time for American innovation. The investments position the nation to continue leading the world in AI, which unlocks substantial economic opportunity for American businesses, advances scientific breakthroughs, fortifies U.S. cybersecurity, and creates new career opportunities for millions of Americans.
