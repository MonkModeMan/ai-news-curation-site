title: "Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Grouping for Tubular Structure Tracking"
description: "arXiv:2506.18930v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge."
