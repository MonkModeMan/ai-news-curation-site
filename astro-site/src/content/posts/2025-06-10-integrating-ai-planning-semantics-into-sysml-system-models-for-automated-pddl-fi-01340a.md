title: Integrating AI Planning Semantics into SysML System Models for Automated PDDL
  File Generation
description: "arXiv:2506.06714v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents\
  \ a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of planning semantics based\
  \ on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into system models. Reusable\
  \ stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as types, predicates, functions\
  \ and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure syntactic consistency. The profile\
  \ was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with\
  \ SysML modeling practices. A case study from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates\
  \ the application of the profile: a robotic system with interchangeable end effectors\
  \ is modeled and enriched to generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL\
  \ format. These are used as input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution\
  \ plans. The approach supports automated and model-based generation of planning\
  \ descriptions and provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning\
  \ in engineering design."
