title: How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network
  Data?
description: "arXiv:2506.11869v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Graphs are a powerful\
  \ data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe\
  \ complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural\
  \ Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning\
  \ is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information\
  \ contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction\
  \ task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks:\
  \ one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate\
  \ their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs\
  \ do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network\
  \ edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed\
  \ by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real\
  \ scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs\
  \ are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally,\
  \ to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks\
  \ in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability."
