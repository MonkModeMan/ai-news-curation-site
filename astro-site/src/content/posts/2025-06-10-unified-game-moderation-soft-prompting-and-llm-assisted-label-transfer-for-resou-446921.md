title: 'Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for
  Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection'
description: "arXiv:2506.06347v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Toxicity detection\
  \ in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges when expanding across\
  \ multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time environments where computational\
  \ efficiency is crucial. We present two key findings to address these challenges\
  \ while building upon our previous work on ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity\
  \ detection system. First, we introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a\
  \ single model to effectively handle multiple games by incorporating game-context\
  \ tokens, matching the performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning\
  \ while offering superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label\
  \ transfer framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.\
  \ Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and Russian\
  \ achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with particularly strong\
  \ performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of 45.39%. In production,\
  \ this unified approach significantly reduces computational resources and maintenance\
  \ overhead compared to maintaining separate models for each game and language combination.\
  \ At Ubisoft, this model successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game,\
  \ per day engaging in sanctionable behavior."
