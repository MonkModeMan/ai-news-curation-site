title: An Active Learning-Based Streaming Pipeline for Reduced Data Training of Structure
  Finding Models in Neutron Diffractometry
description: "arXiv:2506.11100v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Structure determination\
  \ workloads in neutron diffractometry are computationally expensive and routinely\
  \ require several hours to many days to determine the structure of a material from\
  \ its neutron diffraction patterns. The potential for machine learning models trained\
  \ on simulated neutron scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks\
  \ have been reported recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train\
  \ these models grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be\
  \ predicted and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge,\
  \ we introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty\
  \ sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that\
  \ prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm its\
  \ efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data while improving\
  \ the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient stream-based training\
  \ workflow that uses this AL policy and present a performance study on two heterogeneous\
  \ platforms to demonstrate that, compared with a conventional training workflow,\
  \ the streaming workflow delivers about 20% shorter training time without any loss\
  \ of accuracy."
