title: 'BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up
  Suite'
description: "arXiv:2506.07116v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Retrieval-Augmented\
  \ Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and\
  \ semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to\
  \ evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However,\
  \ its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such\
  \ as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy\
  \ and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in\
  \ seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and\
  \ Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.\n  In this study, we present MARCUS,\
  \ a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically\
  \ clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies\
  \ dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving\
  \ answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations\
  \ demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in\
  \ both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers.\
  \ We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future\
  \ research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval."

Title:BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.
