title: Can Time-Series Foundation Models Perform Building Energy Management Tasks?
description: "arXiv:2506.11250v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Building energy\
  \ management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a variety of time-series\
  \ data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and data-specific models to perform\
  \ these tasks, limiting their broader applicability. Inspired by the transformative\
  \ success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),\
  \ trained on diverse datasets, have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to\
  \ achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they\
  \ could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand\
  \ where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability\
  \ in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal\
  \ behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks,\
  \ and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions.\
  \ Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited} generalizability, performing\
  \ only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities\
  \ for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not\
  \ yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional\
  \ models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations\
  \ for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models\
  \ in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs\
  \ forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle\
  \ in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings\
  \ underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their\
  \ handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction\
  \ mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM."
