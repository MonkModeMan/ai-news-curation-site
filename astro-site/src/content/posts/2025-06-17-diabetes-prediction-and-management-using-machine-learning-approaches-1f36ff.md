title: Diabetes Prediction and Management Using Machine Learning Approaches
description: "arXiv:2506.11501v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Diabetes has emerged\
  \ as a significant global health issue, especially with the increasing number of\
  \ cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the need for a greater emphasis\
  \ on early detection and proactive management to avert or mitigate the severe health\
  \ complications of this disease. Over recent years, machine learning algorithms\
  \ have shown promising potential in predicting diabetes risk and are beneficial\
  \ for practitioners. Objective: This study highlights the prediction capabilities\
  \ of statistical and non-statistical machine learning methods over Diabetes risk\
  \ classification in 768 samples from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists\
  \ of the significant demographic and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI)\
  \ and blood glucose levels that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes.\
  \ The experimentation assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms\
  \ in terms of accuracy and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms\
  \ include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors,\
  \ Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models.\
  \ The results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive\
