title: "From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery in Transformers"
description: "arXiv:2506.17052v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing 'safety' and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying 'reasoning'. Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet."
