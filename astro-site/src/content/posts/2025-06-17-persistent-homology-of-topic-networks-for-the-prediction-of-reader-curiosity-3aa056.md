title: Persistent Homology of Topic Networks for the Prediction of Reader Curiosity
description: "arXiv:2506.11095v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Reader curiosity,\
  \ the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual engagement, yet remains\
  \ relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory,\
  \ we introduce a framework that models reader curiosity by quantifying semantic\
  \ information gaps within a text's semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired\
  \ topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected\
  \ components, cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,\
  \ treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically evaluate\
  \ this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants (n = 49)\
  \ as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the topological\
  \ features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict these ratings,\
  \ and experimentally show that they significantly improve curiosity prediction compared\
  \ to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained deviance), validating our approach.\
  \ This pipeline offers a new computational method for analyzing text structure and\
  \ its relation to reader engagement."
