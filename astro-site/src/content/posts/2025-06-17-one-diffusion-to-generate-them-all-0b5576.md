title: One Diffusion to Generate Them All
description: "arXiv:2411.16318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce\
  \ OneDiffusion, a versatile, large-scale diffusion model that seamlessly supports\
  \ bidirectional image synthesis and understanding across diverse tasks. It enables\
  \ conditional generation from inputs such as text, depth, pose, layout, and semantic\
  \ maps, while also handling tasks like image deblurring, upscaling, and reverse\
  \ processes such as depth estimation and segmentation. Additionally, OneDiffusion\
  \ allows for multi-view generation, camera pose estimation, and instant personalization\
  \ using sequential image inputs. Our model takes a straightforward yet effective\
  \ approach by treating all tasks as frame sequences with varying noise scales during\
  \ training, allowing any frame to act as a conditioning image at inference time.\
  \ Our unified training framework removes the need for specialized architectures,\
  \ supports scalable multi-task training, and adapts smoothly to any resolution,\
  \ enhancing both generalization and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate\
  \ competitive performance across tasks in both generation and prediction such as\
  \ text-to-image, multiview generation, ID preservation, depth estimation and camera\
  \ pose estimation despite relatively small training dataset. Our code and checkpoint\
