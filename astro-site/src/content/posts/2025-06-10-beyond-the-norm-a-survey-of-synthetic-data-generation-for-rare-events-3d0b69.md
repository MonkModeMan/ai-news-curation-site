title: 'Beyond the Norm: A Survey of Synthetic Data Generation for Rare Events'
description: "arXiv:2506.06380v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Extreme events,\
  \ such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are rare but catastrophic,\
  \ often triggering cascading failures across interconnected systems. Accurate prediction\
  \ and early warning can help minimize losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven\
  \ methods offer powerful capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant\
  \ training data, yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental\
  \ challenge. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However,\
  \ existing surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather\
  \ than extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the\
  \ first overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically\
  \ review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly\
  \ those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and sampling\
  \ mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize benchmark datasets\
  \ and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering statistical, dependence,\
  \ visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central contribution is our in-depth analysis\
  \ of each metric's applicability in extremeness and domain-specific adaptations,\
  \ providing actionable guidance for model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize\
  \ key application domains and identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance,\
  \ wildfires, earthquakes, windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline\
  \ open challenges, providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event\

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data, yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events.
