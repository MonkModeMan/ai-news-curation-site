title: 'The Memory Paradox: Why Our Brains Need Knowledge in an Age of AI'
description: "arXiv:2506.11015v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the age of generative\
  \ AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as\
  \ external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing\
  \ on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance\
  \ on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative\
  \ and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and\
  \ long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit\

  \ neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning\
  \ phenomena such as \"grokking\" and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition.\
  \ Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning\
  \ inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI\
  \ interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological \"schemata\" and neural\

Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding.
