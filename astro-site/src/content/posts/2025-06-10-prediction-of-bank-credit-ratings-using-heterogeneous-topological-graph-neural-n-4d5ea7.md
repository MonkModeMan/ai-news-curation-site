description: "arXiv:2506.06293v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Agencies such as\
  \ Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings that influence economic\
  \ stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate and timely predictions\
  \ support informed decision-making, regulatory actions, and investor protection.\
  \ However, a complete interbank connection graph is often unavailable due to privacy\
  \ concerns, complicating the direct application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\

  \ a network that captures relationships among banks and combines this with a traditional\
  \ lending network to create a heterogeneous network that integrates information\
  \ from both sources, leading to improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world\
  \ dataset validate the effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for\
