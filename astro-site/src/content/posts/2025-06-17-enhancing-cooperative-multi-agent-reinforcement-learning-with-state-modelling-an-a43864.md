title: Enhancing Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with State Modelling
  and Adversarial Exploration
description: "arXiv:2505.05262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Learning\
  \ to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with no communication\
  \ abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\
  \ (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring\
  \ state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these\
  \ representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution\
  \ policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative\
  \ MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable\
  \ state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant\
  \ and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we\
  \ propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative\
  \ abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs\
  \ into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration\
  \ policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving\
  \ the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms\
  \ state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE,\
  \ LBF, and RWARE benchmarks."
