title: Efficient Generation of Diverse Cooperative Agents with World Models
description: "arXiv:2506.07450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A major bottleneck\
  \ in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) agents is the generation\
  \ of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative conventions. Current Cross-play\
  \ Minimization (XPM) methods for population generation can be very computationally\
  \ expensive and sample inefficient as the training objective requires sampling multiple\
  \ types of trajectories. Each partner agent in the population is also trained from\
  \ scratch, despite all of the partners in the population learning policies of the\
  \ same coordination task. In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from\
  \ the dynamics model of an environment can drastically speed up the training process\
  \ for XPM methods. We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories\
  \ for XPM via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories\
  \ removes the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed\
  \ method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match the\
  \ performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward as well\
  \ as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly more sample\
  \ efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners."

Title:Efficient Generation of Diverse Cooperative Agents with World Models
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task. In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods. We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.
