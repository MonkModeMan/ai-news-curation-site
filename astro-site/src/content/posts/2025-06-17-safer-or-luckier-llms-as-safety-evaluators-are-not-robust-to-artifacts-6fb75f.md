title: Safer or Luckier? LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts
description: "arXiv:2503.09347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large Language\
  \ Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the\
  \ safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain.\
  \ This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety\
  \ domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks,\
  \ alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as\
  \ apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges\
  \ can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer,\
  \ undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language\
  \ artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\\%. Contrary to expectations,\
  \ larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models\
  \ sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator\
  \ robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions\
  \ from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances\
  \ alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best\
  \ jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified,\
  \ artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments."
