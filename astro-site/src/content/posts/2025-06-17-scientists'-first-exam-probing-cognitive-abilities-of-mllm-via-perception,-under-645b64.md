title: 'Scientists'' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception,
  Understanding, and Reasoning'
description: "arXiv:2506.10521v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Scientific discoveries\
  \ increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive\
  \ scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific\
  \ benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential\
  \ to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However,\
  \ current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding\
  \ capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception\
  \ and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First\
  \ Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities\
  \ of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific\
  \ attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises\
  \ 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal\
  \ tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current\
  \ state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE,\
  \ highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope\
  \ the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced\
  \ scientific discoveries."
