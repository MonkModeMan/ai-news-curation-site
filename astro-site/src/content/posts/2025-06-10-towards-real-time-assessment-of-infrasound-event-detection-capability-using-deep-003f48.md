title: Towards real-time assessment of infrasound event detection capability using
  deep learning-based transmission loss estimation

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models. However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss predictions almost instantaneously.

In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric models, improving the overall performance.

Its evaluation on the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive sources.
