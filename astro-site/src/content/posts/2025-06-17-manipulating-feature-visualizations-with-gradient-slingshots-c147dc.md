title: Manipulating Feature Visualizations with Gradient Slingshots
description: "arXiv:2401.06122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Feature\
  \ Visualization (FV) is a widely used technique for interpreting the concepts learned\
  \ by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which synthesizes input patterns that maximally\
  \ activate a given feature. Despite its popularity, the trustworthiness of FV explanations\
  \ has received limited attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, Gradient\
  \ Slingshots, that enables manipulation of FV without modifying the model architecture\
  \ or significantly degrading its performance. By shaping new trajectories in the\
  \ off-distribution regions of the activation landscape of a feature, we coerce the\
  \ optimization process to converge in a predefined visualization. We evaluate our\
  \ approach on several DNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to replace faithfuls\
  \ FV with arbitrary targets. These results expose a critical vulnerability: auditors\
  \ relying solely on FV may accept entirely fabricated explanations. To mitigate\
  \ this risk, we propose a straightforward defense and quantitatively demonstrate\
  \ its effectiveness."
