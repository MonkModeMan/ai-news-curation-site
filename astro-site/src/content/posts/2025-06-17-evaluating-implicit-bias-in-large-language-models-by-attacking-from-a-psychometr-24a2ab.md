title: Evaluating Implicit Bias in Large Language Models by Attacking From a Psychometric
  Perspective
description: "arXiv:2406.14023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As large\
  \ language models (LLMs) become an important way of information access, there have\
  \ been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread of unethical content,\
  \ including implicit bias that hurts certain populations without explicit harmful\
  \ words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias\
  \ towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective\
  \ to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles\
  \ in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e.,\
  \ Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions,\
  \ we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering\
  \ four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE,\
  \ a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive\
  \ evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows\
  \ that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive\
  \ baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing\
  \ the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their\
  \ development. Our code, data, and benchmarks are available at https://yuchenwen1.github.io/ImplicitBiasEvaluation/."
