title: Translating Federated Learning Algorithms in Python into CSP Processes Using
  ChatGPT
description: "arXiv:2506.07173v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Python Testbed\
  \ for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL framework that is easy\
  \ to use by ML&amp;AI developers who do not need to be professional programmers\
  \ and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous research, generic federated learning\
  \ algorithms provided by this framework were manually translated into the CSP processes\
  \ and algorithms' safety and liveness properties were automatically verified by\
  \ the model checker PAT. In this paper, a simple translation process is introduced\
  \ wherein the ChatGPT is used to automate the translation of the mentioned federated\
  \ learning algorithms in Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the\
  \ process, the minimality of the used context is estimated based on the feedback\
  \ from ChatGPT. The proposed translation process was experimentally validated by\
  \ successful translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized\
  \ and decentralized federated learning algorithms."
