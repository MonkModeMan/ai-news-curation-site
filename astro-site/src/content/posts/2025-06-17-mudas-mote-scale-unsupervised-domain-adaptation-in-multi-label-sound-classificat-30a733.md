title: 'MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification'
description: "arXiv:2506.11331v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Unsupervised Domain\
  \ Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine learning models to new, unlabeled\
  \ environments where data distribution shifts can degrade performance. Existing\
  \ UDA algorithms are designed for single-label tasks and rely on significant computational\
  \ resources, limiting their use in multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained\
  \ IoT devices. Overcoming these limitations is particularly challenging in contexts\
  \ such as urban sound classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics\
  \ require robust, adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems.\
  \ To address these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\
  \ for Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification\

  \ and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment. Additionally, MUDAS incorporates\
