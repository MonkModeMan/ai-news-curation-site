title: Test-Time-Scaling for Zero-Shot Diagnosis with Visual-Language Reasoning
description: "arXiv:2506.11166v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As a cornerstone\
  \ of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly influences patient outcomes\
  \ and can be enhanced by large language models (LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated\

Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored.
