title: 'Towards Efficient Multi-LLM Inference: Characterization and Analysis of LLM
  Routing and Hierarchical Techniques'
description: "arXiv:2506.06579v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent progress\
  \ in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field of natural language\
  \ processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation, summarization, and\
  \ question answering. However, their inference remains computationally expensive\
  \ and energy intensive, especially in settings with limited hardware, power, or\
  \ bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in mobile, edge, or cost sensitive\
  \ environments. To address these challenges, recent approaches have introduced multi\
  \ LLM intelligent model selection strategies that dynamically allocate computational\
  \ resources based on query complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries\
  \ and escalating to larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two\
  \ complementary strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects\
  \ the most suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical\
  \ inference (HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident\
  \ response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using lightweight\
  \ models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We provide a comparative\
  \ analysis of these techniques across key performance metrics, discuss benchmarking\
  \ efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we outline future research directions\
  \ to enable faster response times, adaptive model selection based on task complexity,\
  \ and scalable deployment across heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems\
  \ more efficient and accessible for real world applications."
