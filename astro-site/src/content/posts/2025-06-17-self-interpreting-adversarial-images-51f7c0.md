title: Self-interpreting Adversarial Images
description: "arXiv:2407.08970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce\
  \ a new type of indirect, cross-modal injection attacks against visual language\
  \ models that enable creation of self-interpreting images. These images contain\
  \ hidden \"meta-instructions\" that control how models answer users' questions about\
  \ the image and steer models' outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment,\
  \ or point of view.\n  Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning\
  \ the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers\
  \ based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form\
  \ of prompt injection. Adversarial images look natural and the model's answers are\
  \ coherent and plausible, yet they also follow the adversary-chosen interpretation,\
  \ e.g., political spin, or even objectives that are not achievable with explicit\
  \ text instructions.\n  We evaluate the efficacy of self-interpreting images for\
  \ a variety of models, interpretations, and user prompts. We describe how these\
  \ attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of self-interpreting content that\
  \ carries spam, misinformation, or spin. Finally, we discuss defenses."

Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form of prompt injection.
