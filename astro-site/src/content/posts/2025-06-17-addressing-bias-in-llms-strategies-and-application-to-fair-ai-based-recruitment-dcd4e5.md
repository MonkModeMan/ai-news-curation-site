title: 'Addressing Bias in LLMs: Strategies and Application to Fair AI-based Recruitment'
description: "arXiv:2506.11880v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The use of language\
  \ technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in recent years, mostly motivated\
  \ by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite the great performance\
  \ of LLMs, they are are susceptible to ethical concerns, such as demographic biases,\
  \ accountability, or privacy. This work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based\
  \ systems to learn demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on\
  \ AI-based automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce\
  \ gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased behaviors\
  \ in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data biases on systems\
  \ built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework effectively prevents\
  \ trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data."
