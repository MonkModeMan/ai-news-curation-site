title: Dynamic and Adaptive Feature Generation with LLM
description: "arXiv:2406.03505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The representation\
  \ of feature space is a crucial environment where data points get vectorized and\
  \ embedded for subsequent modeling. Thus the efficacy of machine learning (ML) algorithms\
  \ is closely related to the quality of feature engineering. As one of the most important\
  \ techniques, feature generation transforms raw data into an optimized feature space\
  \ conducive to model training and further refines the space. Despite the advancements\
  \ in automated feature engineering and feature generation, current methodologies\
  \ often suffer from three fundamental issues: lack of explainability, limited applicability,\
  \ and inflexible strategy. These shortcomings frequently hinder and limit the deployment\
  \ of ML models across varied scenarios. Our research introduces a novel approach\
  \ adopting large language models (LLMs) and feature-generating prompts to address\
  \ these challenges. We propose a dynamic and adaptive feature generation method\
  \ that enhances the interpretability of the feature generation process. Our approach\
  \ broadens the applicability across various data types and tasks and offers advantages\
  \ over strategic flexibility. A broad range of experiments showcases that our approach\
  \ is significantly superior to existing methods."
