title: '"It''s not a representation of me": Examining Accent Bias and Digital Exclusion
  in Synthetic AI Voice Services'
description: "arXiv:2504.09346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advances\
  \ in artificial intelligence (AI) speech generation and voice cloning technologies\
  \ have produced naturalistic speech and accurate voice replication, yet their influence\
  \ on sociotechnical systems across diverse accents and linguistic traits is not\
  \ fully understood. This study evaluates two synthetic AI voice services (Speechify\
  \ and ElevenLabs) through a mixed methods approach using surveys and interviews\
  \ to assess technical performance and uncover how users' lived experiences influence\
  \ their perceptions of accent variations in these speech technologies. Our findings\
  \ reveal technical performance disparities across five regional, English-language\
  \ accents and demonstrate how current speech generation technologies may inadvertently\
  \ reinforce linguistic privilege and accent-based discrimination, potentially creating\
  \ new forms of digital exclusion. Overall, our study highlights the need for inclusive\
  \ design and regulation by providing actionable insights for developers, policymakers,\
  \ and organizations to ensure equitable and socially responsible AI speech technologies."
