title: 'Explainable-AI powered stock price prediction using time series transformers:
  A Case Study on BIST100'
description: "arXiv:2506.06345v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Financial literacy\
  \ is increasingly dependent on the ability to interpret complex financial data and\
  \ utilize advanced forecasting tools. In this context, this study proposes a novel\
  \ approach that combines transformer-based time series models with explainable artificial\
  \ intelligence (XAI) to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of stock price\
  \ predictions. The analysis focuses on the daily stock prices of the five highest-volume\
  \ banks listed in the BIST100 index, along with XBANK and XU100 indices, covering\
  \ the period from January 2015 to March 2025. Models including DLinear, LTSNet,\
  \ Vanilla Transformer, and Time Series Transformer are employed, with input features\
  \ enriched by technical indicators. SHAP and LIME techniques are used to provide\
  \ transparency into the influence of individual features on model outputs. The results\
  \ demonstrate the strong predictive capabilities of transformer models and highlight\
  \ the potential of interpretable machine learning to empower individuals in making\
  \ informed investment decisions and actively engaging in financial markets."
