title: 'TrajAgent: An LLM-based Agent Framework for Automated Trajectory Modeling
  via Collaboration of Large and Small Models'
description: "arXiv:2410.20445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Trajectory\
  \ modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future\
  \ prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban\
  \ transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed\
  \ to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity\
  \ of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory\
  \ modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts.\
  \ In this paper, we propose \\textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large\
  \ language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory\
  \ modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse\
  \ specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different\
  \ datasets effectively. In \\textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \\textit{UniEnv},\

  \ execution and training of various models. Building on \\textit{UniEnv}, we introduce\

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling.
