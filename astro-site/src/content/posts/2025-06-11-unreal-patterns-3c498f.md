title: Unreal Patterns
description: "arXiv:2506.06284v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces\
  \ a framework for representing information about entities that do not exist or may\
  \ never exist, such as those involving fictional entities, blueprints, simulations,\
  \ and future scenarios. Traditional approaches that introduce \"dummy instances\"\
  \ or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a proposal is defended in which such\
  \ cases are modeled using the intersections of actual types rather than specific\
  \ non existent tokens. The paper positions itself within the Basic Formal Ontology\
  \ and its realist commitments, emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable\
  \ solutions over purely metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing\
  \ approaches to non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions\
  \ or introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing\
  \ a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to provide\
  \ a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to hypothetical\
  \ or non existent entities."
