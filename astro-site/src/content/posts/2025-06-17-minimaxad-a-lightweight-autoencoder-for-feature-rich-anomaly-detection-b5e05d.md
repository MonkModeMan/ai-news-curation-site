title: 'MiniMaxAD: A Lightweight Autoencoder for Feature-Rich Anomaly Detection'
description: "arXiv:2405.09933v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Previous\
  \ industrial anomaly detection methods often struggle to handle the extensive diversity\
  \ in training sets, particularly when they contain stylistically diverse and feature-rich\
  \ samples, which we categorize as feature-rich anomaly detection datasets (FRADs).\
  \ This challenge is evident in applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios.\
  \ To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a efficient autoencoder designed\
  \ to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images.\
  \ Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing\
  \ the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution\
  \ to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact\
  \ feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining\
  \ Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs. In our methodology, any dataset\
  \ can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly detection, in a way\
  \ that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art\
  \ performance in multiple challenging benchmarks. Code is available at: \\href{https://github.com/WangFengJiee/MiniMaxAD}{https://github.com/WangFengJiee/MiniMaxAD}"
