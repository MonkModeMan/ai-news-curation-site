title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning Xiangqi Player with Monte Carlo Tree Search"
description: "arXiv:2506.15880v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system for Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) that integrates neural networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable strategic self-play and self-improvement. Addressing the underexplored complexity of Xiangqi, including its unique board layout, piece movement constraints, and victory conditions, our approach combines policy-value networks with MCTS to simulate move consequences and refine decision-making. By overcoming challenges such as Xiangqi's high branching factor and asymmetrical piece dynamics, our work advances AI capabilities in culturally significant strategy games while providing insights for adapting DRL-MCTS frameworks to domain-specific rule systems."
