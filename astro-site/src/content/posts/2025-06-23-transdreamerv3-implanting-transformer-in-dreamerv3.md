title: "TransDreamerV3: Implanting Transformer In DreamerV3"
description: "arXiv:2506.17103v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper introduces TransDreamerV3, a reinforcement learning model that enhances the DreamerV3 architecture by integrating a transformer encoder. The model is designed to improve memory and decision-making capabilities in complex environments. We conducted experiments on Atari-Boxing, Atari-Freeway, Atari-Pong, and Crafter tasks, where TransDreamerV3 demonstrated improved performance over DreamerV3, particularly in the Atari-Freeway and Crafter tasks. While issues in the Minecraft task and limited training across all tasks were noted, TransDreamerV3 displays advancement in world model-based reinforcement learning, leveraging transformer architectures."
