Highlights from the Dialogues stage at I/O 2025
Last week, the Dialogues stage at Google I/O 2025 brought together Google leaders and visionaries like director Darren Aronofsky for conversations on the technological breakthroughs helping to shape society and our future. The talks explored AI innovations and some of the biggest opportunities and questions facing us today, from the frontiers of quantum computing to scientific advances to the evolution of storytelling. Take a look at what we discussed.
Demis Hassabis on the frontiers of AI
Google DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis and Google co-founder Sergey Brin sat down with Big Technology Podcast’s Alex Kantrowitz for a fascinating conversation around the latest advancements in AI, the path to AGI and much more.
Liz Reid, Koray Kavucuoglu and Josh Woodward on our big I/O announcements
Logan Kilpatrick, group product manager at Google, took attendees behind the scenes of our latest AI announcements with Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO, Google DeepMind, Liz Reid, VP, Head of Search, and Josh Woodward VP, Google Labs & Gemini. Inspired by our ambition for the Gemini app to be a "truly universal AI assistant," the group emphasized the importance of making AI interactions more personal and proactive, ultimately meeting people where they are.
Anima Anandkumar, Joëlle Barral and Pushmeet Kohli on AI and the latest scientific breakthroughs
I moderated a conversation with Google DeepMind’s VP of Science and Strategic Initiatives Pushmeet Kohli, Senior Director of Research & Engineering Joëlle Barral, and Caltech professor Anima Anandkumar. We discussed how AI is transforming scientific discovery, highlighting recent research on conversational medical AI, accelerating research on bacterial infections, and improving weather forecasts, and many more, as well as sharing predictions for future breakthroughs.
Darren Aronofsky, Demis Hassabis and Eliza McNitt on storytelling in the age of AI
Director Darren Aronofsky and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis shared their views, in a conversation moderated by Google’s VP of Technology & Society Mira Lane, on how AI is shaping the future of storytelling. They discussed the strategic partnership between Primordial Soup and Google DeepMind and how they are integrating new technologies into storytelling. They previewed the first of three short films in production, "ANCESTRA" directed by Eliza McNitt, who joined them on stage.
Julian Kelly on reading signals from the noise in quantum computing
Julian Kelly from the Google Quantum AI team sat down with Sinead Bovell, futurist and founder of WAYE, to talk about future real-world applications for quantum, recent breakthroughs and more. They discussed how this could help us understand how a drug interacts in the body more than existing tools, and help drug developers hone in on the right ones. This is a crucial insight that can save researchers a ton of time and money.
Waymo’s Dmitri Dolgov on how AI is powering the future of driving
Dmitri Dolgov, co-CEO of Waymo, walked us through the company’s evolution from its early days as the Google Self-Driving Car Project to present. He helped bring to life the complexity of their work — after all, every day the Waymo Driver encounters situations that many of us would never see in a lifetime of driving. Dmitri also discussed the critical role of AI in autonomous vehicles, and shared how Waymo represents the most mature application of AI in the physical world today that has now reached a milestone of 10 million rides.
Turing Award laureate David Patterson on sustainability
In his tongue-in-cheek talk, “How to give AI a bad carbon footprint,” Google’s Distinguished Software Engineer David Patterson dispelled common fallacies and provided valuable perspectives on building more sustainable AI systems. To cap off the day, Dave discussed life lessons he’s learned along the way: Follow what you love, cherish the people who you love and optimize for happiness.
