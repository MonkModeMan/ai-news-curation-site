title: VLM@school -- Evaluation of AI image understanding on German middle school
  knowledge
description: "arXiv:2506.11604v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces\
  \ a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of Vision Language\
  \ Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual reasoning with subject-specific background\
  \ knowledge in the German language. In contrast to widely used English-language\
  \ benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems,\
  \ this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including\
  \ mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000\
  \ open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate\
  \ visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual\
  \ cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions,\
  \ including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions.\
  \ Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall\
  \ accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial\
  \ settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between\
  \ success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude\
  \ that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for\
  \ stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation\
  \ protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual\
  \ and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems."
