title: Graph-based RAG Enhancement via Global Query Disambiguation and Dependency-Aware
  Reranking
description: "arXiv:2506.11106v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Contemporary graph-based\
  \ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically begin by extracting entities\
  \ from user queries and then leverage pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve\
  \ related relationships and metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance\
  \ on entity-level extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent\
  \ yet critical information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be\
