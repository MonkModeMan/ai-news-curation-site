title: Contextual Experience Replay for Self-Improvement of Language Agents
description: "arXiv:2506.06698v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language model\
  \ (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential decision-making tasks such as web\
  \ navigation, but without any environment-specific experiences, they often fail\
  \ in these complex tasks. Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually\
  \ learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for\
  \ them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose\
  \ Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient\
  \ self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER\
  \ accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These\
  \ experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns,\
  \ allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge\
  \ in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate\
  \ CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena,\
  \ CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a\
  \ competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate\
  \ of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis\
  \ on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better."
