title: Improving Child Speech Recognition and Reading Mistake Detection by Using Prompts
description: "arXiv:2506.11079v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Automatic reading\
  \ aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers by enabling more efficient\
  \ scoring of reading exercises. However, research on reading evaluation systems\
  \ and applications remains limited. We present a novel multimodal approach that\
  \ leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In particular, we explored\
  \ the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs)\
  \ with prompts to improve transcriptions for child speech recognition, as well as\
  \ their effectiveness in downstream reading mistake detection. Our results demonstrate\
  \ the effectiveness of prompting Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline\
  \ Whisper model without prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art\
  \ recognition performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER)\
  \ of 5.1%, improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved\
  \ reading mistake detection, increasing the F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73."
