title: 'Output Scaling: YingLong-Delayed Chain of Thought in a Large Pretrained Time
  Series Forecasting Model'
description: "arXiv:2506.11029v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We present a joint\
  \ forecasting framework for time series prediction that contrasts with traditional\
  \ direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance\
  \ for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and reveals a novel scaling effect:\
