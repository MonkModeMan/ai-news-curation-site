title: Facial Foundational Model Advances Early Warning of Coronary Artery Disease
  from Live Videos with DigitalShadow
description: "arXiv:2506.06283v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Global population\
  \ aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems, with coronary artery\
  \ disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million deaths annually, making\
  \ it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is largely preventable, early detection\
