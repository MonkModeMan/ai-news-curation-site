title: 'An overview of domain-specific foundation model: key technologies, applications
  and challenges'
description: "arXiv:2409.04267v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The impressive\
  \ performance of ChatGPT and other foundation-model-based products in human language\
  \ understanding has prompted both academia and industry to explore how these models\
  \ can be tailored for specific industries and application scenarios. This process,\
  \ known as the customization of domain-specific foundation models (FMs), addresses\
  \ the limitations of general-purpose models, which may not fully capture the unique\
  \ patterns and requirements of domain-specific data. Despite its importance, there\
  \ is a notable lack of comprehensive overview papers on building domain-specific\
  \ FMs, while numerous resources exist for general-purpose models. To bridge this\
  \ gap, this article provides a timely and thorough overview of the methodology for\
  \ customizing domain-specific FMs. It introduces basic concepts, outlines the general\
  \ architecture, and surveys key methods for constructing domain-specific models.\
  \ Furthermore, the article discusses various domains that can benefit from these\

  \ we aim to offer valuable guidance and reference for researchers and practitioners\
