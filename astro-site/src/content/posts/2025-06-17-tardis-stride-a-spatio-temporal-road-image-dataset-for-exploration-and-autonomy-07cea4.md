title: 'TARDIS STRIDE: A Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration and Autonomy'
description: "arXiv:2506.11302v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: World models aim\
  \ to simulate environments and enable effective agent behavior. However, modeling\
  \ real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change\
  \ across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we\
  \ introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting\
  \ 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action\
  \ nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship\
  \ between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across\
  \ both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based\
  \ generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a\
  \ unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance\
  \ across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,\
  \ instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing.\
  \ These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable\
  \ of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material\
  \ environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets,\
  \ and model checkpoints are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE."
