title: 'Learning from Litigation: Graphs and LLMs for Retrieval and Reasoning in eDiscovery'
description: "arXiv:2405.19164v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Electronic Discovery\
  \ (eDiscovery) requires identifying relevant documents from vast collections for\
  \ legal production requests. While artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language\
  \ processing (NLP) have improved document review efficiency, current methods still\
  \ struggle with legal entities, citations, and complex legal artifacts. To address\
  \ these challenges, we introduce DISCOvery Graph (DISCOG), an emerging system that\
  \ integrates knowledge graphs for enhanced document ranking and classification,\
  \ augmented by LLM-driven reasoning. DISCOG outperforms strong baselines in F1-score,\
  \ precision, and recall across both balanced and imbalanced datasets. In real-world\
  \ deployments, it has reduced litigation-related document review costs by approximately\
  \ 98\\%, demonstrating significant business impact."
