title: 'A Tale of Two Systems: Characterizing Architectural Complexity on Machine
  Learning-Enabled Systems'
description: "arXiv:2506.11295v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: How can the complexity\
  \ of ML-enabled systems be managed effectively? The goal of this research is to\
  \ investigate how complexity affects ML-Enabled Systems (MLES). To address this\
  \ question, this research aims to introduce a metrics-based architectural model\
  \ to characterize the complexity of MLES. The goal is to support architectural decisions,\
  \ providing a guideline for the inception and growth of these systems. This paper\
  \ brings, side-by-side, the architecture representation of two systems that can\
  \ be used as case studies for creating the metrics-based architectural model: the\
  \ SPIRA and the Ocean Guard MLES."
