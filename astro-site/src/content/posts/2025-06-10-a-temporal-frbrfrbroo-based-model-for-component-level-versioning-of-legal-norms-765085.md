title: A Temporal FRBR/FRBRoo-Based Model for Component-Level Versioning of Legal
  Norms
description: "arXiv:2506.07853v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effectively representing\
  \ legal norms for automated processing is a critical challenge, particularly in\
  \ tracking the diachronic evolution of their hierarchical components (e.g., articles,\
  \ paragraphs). While foundational frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like\
  \ Akoma Ntoso model legal documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms\
  \ for granular, component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic\
  \ point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for reliable\
  \ Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured, temporal model\
  \ that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It introduces specialized\
  \ subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and Language Version (LV - to\
  \ represent the state of a legal norm and its linguistic variations at specific\
  \ points in time. The model applies this same paradigm hierarchically, introducing\
  \ Component Work (CW), Component Temporal Version (CTV), and Component Language\
  \ Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses.\
  \ Using the Brazilian Federal Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates\
  \ how each amendment creates new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions,\
  \ while unaffected components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained,\
  \ time-aware architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction\
  \ of any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides\
  \ a robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge\
