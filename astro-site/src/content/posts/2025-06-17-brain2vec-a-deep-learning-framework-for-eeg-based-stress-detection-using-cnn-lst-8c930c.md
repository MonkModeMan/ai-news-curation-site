  CNN-LSTM-Attention'
description: "arXiv:2506.11179v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Mental stress has\
  \ become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and overall well-being, necessitating\
  \ the development of robust, non-invasive diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram\
  \ (EEG) signals provide a direct window into neural activity, yet their non-stationary\

  \ Brain2Vec, a new deep learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG\
  \ recordings using a hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention\
  \ mechanisms. The model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture\
  \ localized spatial dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential\
  \ temporal patterns, and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative\
