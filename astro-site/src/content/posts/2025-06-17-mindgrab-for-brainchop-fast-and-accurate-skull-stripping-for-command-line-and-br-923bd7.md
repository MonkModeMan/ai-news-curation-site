title: 'MindGrab for BrainChop: Fast and Accurate Skull Stripping for Command Line
  and Browser'
description: "arXiv:2506.11860v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We developed MindGrab,\
  \ a parameter- and memory-efficient deep fully-convolutional model for volumetric\
  \ skull-stripping in head images of any modality. Its architecture, informed by\
  \ a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, was trained exclusively on\
  \ modality-agnostic synthetic data. MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset\
  \ of 606 multimodal adult-brain scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET)\
  \ sourced from the SynthStrip dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip,\
  \ ROBEX, and BET using Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests.\
  \ MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across\
  \ modalities, significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7,\
  \ P < 0.05; BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),\
  \ MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the tested\
  \ scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab utilized\
  \ 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This efficiency\
  \ yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on GPUs, and enabled\
  \ exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x memory reduction)\
  \ and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including systems without high-end\
  \ GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with dramatically lower resource\
  \ demands, supported in brainchop-cli (https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and\
  \ at brainchop.org."
