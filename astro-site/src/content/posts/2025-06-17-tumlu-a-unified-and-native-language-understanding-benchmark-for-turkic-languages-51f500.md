title: 'TUMLU: A Unified and Native Language Understanding Benchmark for Turkic Languages'
description: "arXiv:2502.11020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Being able\
  \ to thoroughly assess massive multi-task language understanding (MMLU) capabilities\
  \ is essential for advancing the applicability of multilingual language models.\
  \ However, preparing such benchmarks in high quality native language is often costly\
  \ and therefore limits the representativeness of evaluation datasets. While recent\
  \ efforts focused on building more inclusive MMLU benchmarks, these are conventionally\
  \ built using machine translation from high-resource languages, which may introduce\
  \ errors and fail to account for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of the\
  \ target languages. In this paper, we address the lack of native language MMLU benchmark\
  \ especially in the under-represented Turkic language family with distinct morphosyntactic\
  \ and cultural characteristics. We propose two benchmarks for Turkic language MMLU:\
  \ TUMLU is a comprehensive, multilingual, and natively developed language understanding\
  \ benchmark specifically designed for Turkic languages. It consists of middle- and\
  \ high-school level questions spanning 11 academic subjects in Azerbaijani, Crimean\
  \ Tatar, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tatar, Turkish, Uyghur, and Uzbek. We also present\
  \ TUMLU-mini, a more concise, balanced, and manually verified subset of the dataset.\
  \ Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate a diverse range of open and proprietary\
  \ multilingual large language models (LLMs), including Claude, Gemini, GPT, and\
  \ LLaMA, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across different languages,\
  \ subjects, and alphabets. To promote further research and development in multilingual\
  \ language understanding, we release TUMLU-mini and all corresponding evaluation\
  \ scripts."
