title: 'GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for
  Query Expansion in Information Retrieval'
description: "arXiv:2506.04762v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models\
  \ (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval augments queries with generated\
  \ hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its performance relies heavily on the\
  \ scale of the language models (LMs), necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs.\
  \ This approach is costly, computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility.\
  \ To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents\
  \ Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source\
  \ LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter\
  \ and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent\
  \ sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter\
  \ combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance\
  \ their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant LLM-based query expansion\
  \ methods on three web search and ten low-resource datasets. Experimental results\
  \ demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms other methods using smaller LMs,\
  \ and maintains competitive performance against methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating\
  \ its effectiveness."
