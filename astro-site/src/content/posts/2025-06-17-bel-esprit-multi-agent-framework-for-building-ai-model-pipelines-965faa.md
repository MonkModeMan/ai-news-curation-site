title: 'Bel Esprit: Multi-Agent Framework for Building AI Model Pipelines'
description: "arXiv:2412.14684v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: As the demand\
  \ for artificial intelligence (AI) grows to address complex real-world tasks, single\
  \ models are often insufficient, requiring the integration of multiple models into\
  \ pipelines. This paper introduces Bel Esprit, a conversational agent designed to\
  \ construct AI model pipelines based on user-defined requirements. Bel Esprit employs\
  \ a multi-agent framework where subagents collaborate to clarify requirements, build,\
  \ validate, and populate pipelines with appropriate models. We demonstrate the effectiveness\
  \ of this framework in generating pipelines from ambiguous user queries, using both\
  \ human-curated and synthetic data. A detailed error analysis highlights ongoing\
  \ challenges in pipeline construction. Bel Esprit is available for a free trial\
  \ at https://belesprit.aixplain.com."
