title: 'OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases'
description: "arXiv:2506.11023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Assurance cases (ACs)\
  \ are a common artifact for building and maintaining confidence in system properties\
  \ such as safety or robustness. Constructing an AC can be challenging, although\
  \ existing tools provide support in static, document-centric applications and methods\
  \ for dynamic contexts (e.g., autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing\

Title:OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static, document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g., autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse, producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this, we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated, evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface.
