title: 'LUCIFER: Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration
  and Behavior Refinement'
description: "arXiv:2506.07915v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In dynamic environments,\
  \ the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental knowledge creates a gap between\
  \ an agent's internal model and the evolving reality of its operational context.\
  \ This disparity between prior and updated environmental valuations fundamentally\
  \ limits the effectiveness of autonomous decision-making. To bridge this gap, the\
  \ contextual bias of human domain stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights\
  \ through direct, real-time observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating\
  \ their nuanced, and context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous\
  \ systems remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language\
  \ Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement),\
  \ a domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making architecture\
  \ with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) into a unified\
  \ system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex tasks, enabling\
  \ a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each focused on distinct\
  \ objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike traditional applications\
  \ where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER integrates them in two synergistic\
  \ roles: as context extractors, structuring verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware\
  \ representations that influence decision-making through an attention space mechanism\
  \ aligning LLM-derived insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot\
  \ exploration facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.\
  \ We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves\
  \ exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat, goal-conditioned\
  \ policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven decision-making, where\
  \ autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge for operational success."

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions.
