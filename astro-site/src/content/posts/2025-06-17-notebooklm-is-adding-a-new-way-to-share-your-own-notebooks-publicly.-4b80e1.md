Many people who use NotebookLM already share their notebooks with classmates, coworkers, students and friends. Today, we're making sharing and curation easier — with public links.
Now, you can share a notebook publicly with anyone using NotebookLM with a single link, whether it’s an overview of your nonprofit’s projects, product manuals for your business or study guides for your class.
Creating a public notebook is simple. Select the “Share” button in the top-right corner of your notebook and set the access to “Anyone with a link.”
Viewers won’t be able to edit source content, but can still interact with a public notebook by asking questions or exploring generated content, such as audio overviews, FAQs or briefing documents.
We are excited to see what the NotebookLM community creates. Public sharing makes NotebookLM an even more powerful tool for exploration, understanding and creation.
