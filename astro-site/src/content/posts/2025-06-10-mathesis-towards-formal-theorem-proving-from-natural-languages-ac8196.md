title: 'Mathesis: Towards Formal Theorem Proving from Natural Languages'
description: "arXiv:2506.07047v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in\
  \ large language models show strong promise for formal reasoning. However, most\
  \ LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained by the need for expert-written\
  \ formal statements as inputs, limiting their applicability to real-world problems\
  \ expressed in natural language. We tackle this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end\
  \ theorem proving pipeline processing informal problem statements. It contributes\
  \ Mathesis-Autoformalizer, the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning\
  \ to enhance the formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our\
  \ novel LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also\
  \ proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized\
  \ statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal theorem\
  \ proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex problems from\
  \ China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully designed, with\
  \ a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate Mathesis's effectiveness,\
  \ with the autoformalizer outperforming the best baseline by 22% in pass-rate on\
  \ Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other model combinations, achieving 64%\
  \ accuracy on MiniF2F with pass@32 and a state-of-the-art 18% on Gaokao-Formal."
