title: 'Addition in Four Movements: Mapping Layer-wise Information Trajectories in
  LLMs'
description: "arXiv:2506.07824v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multi-digit addition\
  \ is a clear probe of the computational power of large language models. To dissect\
  \ the internal arithmetic processes in LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing\
  \ with logit-lens inspection. Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans\
  \ perform addition, we propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the\
  \ forward pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first,\
  \ while the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational\
  \ features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical abstractions\
  \ of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and decoding of\
  \ the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model organizes and generates\
  \ the final content, with the correct token reliably occupying the top rank.This\
  \ trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that favors internal computation over\
  \ rote memorization. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility."
