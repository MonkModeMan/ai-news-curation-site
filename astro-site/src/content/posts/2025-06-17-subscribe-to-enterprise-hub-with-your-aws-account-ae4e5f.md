If you're admin of your organization, you can upgrade it easily with a credit card. But how do you upgrade your organization to Enterprise Hub using your AWS account? We'll walk you through it step by step below.
1. Getting Started
Before you can connect your AWS Account with your Hugging Face account, you need to fulfill the following prerequisites:
- Have access to an active AWS account with access to subscribe to products on the AWS Marketplace.
- Create a Hugging Face organization account with a registered and confirmed email. (You cannot connect user accounts)
- Be a member of the Hugging Face organization you want to connect with the ‚Äúadmin‚Äù role.
- Logged into the Hugging Face Platform.
Once you meet these requirements, you can proceed with connecting your AWS and Hugging Face accounts.
2. Connect your Hugging Face Account with your AWS Account
The first step is to go to the AWS Marketplace offering and subscribe to the Hugging Face Platform. There you open the offer and then click on ‚ÄúView purchase options‚Äù at the top right screen.
You are now on the ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù page, where you can see the summary of pricing and where you can subscribe. To subscribe to the offer, click ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù.
After you successfully subscribe, you should see a green banner at the top with a button ‚ÄúSet up your account‚Äù. You need to click on ‚ÄúSet up your account‚Äù to connect your Hugging Face Account with your AWS account.
After clicking the button, you will be redirected to the Hugging Face Platform, where you can select the Hugging Face organization account you want to link to your AWS account. After selecting your account, click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù
After clicking "Submit", you will be redirected to the Billings settings of the Hugging Face organization, where you can see the current state of your subscription, which should be subscribe-pending
.
After a few minutes, you should receive 2 emails: 1 from AWS confirming your subscription and 1 from Hugging Face, which should look like the image below:
If you have received this, your AWS Account and Hugging Face organization account are now successfully connected!
To confirm it, you can open the Billing settings for your organization account, where you should now see a subscribe-success
status.
3. Activate the Enterprise Hub for your team and unlock new features
