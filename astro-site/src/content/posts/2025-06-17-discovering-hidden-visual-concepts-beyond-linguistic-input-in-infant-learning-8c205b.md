title: Discovering Hidden Visual Concepts Beyond Linguistic Input in Infant Learning
description: "arXiv:2501.05205v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Infants\
  \ develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding the acquisition of\
  \ linguistic skills. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system,\
  \ understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper,\
  \ we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational\
  \ model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts\
  \ that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally\
  \ learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by\
  \ Vong et al., which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child\
  \ paired with transcribed parental speech. We perform neuron labeling to identify\
  \ visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. We then\
  \ demonstrate that these neurons can recognize objects beyond the model's original\
  \ vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the differences in representation between\
  \ infant models and those in modern computer vision models, such as CLIP and ImageNet\
  \ pre-trained model. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer\
  \ vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained\
  \ on an infant visual and linguistic inputs. Project page is available at https://kexueyi.github.io/webpage-discover-hidden-visual-concepts."
