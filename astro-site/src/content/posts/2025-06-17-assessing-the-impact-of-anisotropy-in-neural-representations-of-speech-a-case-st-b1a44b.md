title: 'Assessing the Impact of Anisotropy in Neural Representations of Speech: A
  Case Study on Keyword Spotting'
description: "arXiv:2506.11096v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Pretrained speech\
  \ representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong anisotropy, leading to\
  \ high similarity between random embeddings. While widely observed, the impact of\
  \ this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This work evaluates anisotropy\
  \ in keyword spotting for computational documentary linguistics. Using Dynamic Time\
  \ Warping, we show that despite anisotropy, wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively\
  \ identify words without transcription. Our results highlight the robustness of\
  \ these representations, which capture phonetic structures and generalize across\
  \ speakers. Our results underscore the importance of pretraining in learning rich\
  \ and invariant speech representations."
