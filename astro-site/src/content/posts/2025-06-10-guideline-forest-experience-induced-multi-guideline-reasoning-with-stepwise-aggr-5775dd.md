title: 'Guideline Forest: Experience-Induced Multi-Guideline Reasoning with Stepwise
  Aggregation'
description: "arXiv:2506.07820v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human reasoning is\
  \ flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior experience-qualities that large language\
  \ models (LLMs) still struggle to emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse\
  \ reasoning paths at inference time or search for optimal workflows through expensive\
  \ operations, but both fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in\
  \ a structured, efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that\
  \ enhances LLMs reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from\
  \ verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike test-time\
  \ search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified reasoning experiences\
  \ by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into diverse variants. Much\
  \ like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative thought patterns, are\
  \ executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and aggregated step by step-enabling\
  \ the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty and synthesize robust solutions.We\
  \ evaluate Guideline Forest on four benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning\
  \ mathematical and programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms\
  \ strong baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies\
  \ further highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,\
  \ underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential."
