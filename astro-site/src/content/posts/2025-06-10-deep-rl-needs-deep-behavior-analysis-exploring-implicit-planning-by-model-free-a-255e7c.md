title: 'Deep RL Needs Deep Behavior Analysis: Exploring Implicit Planning by Model-Free
  Agents in Open-Ended Environments'
description: "arXiv:2506.06981v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding the\
  \ behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents -- particularly as task and\
  \ agent sophistication increase -- requires more than simple comparison of reward\
  \ curves, yet standard methods for behavioral analysis remain underdeveloped in\
  \ DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and ethology to study DRL agents in a novel,\
  \ complex, partially observable environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key\
  \ aspects of real-world animal foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource\
  \ patches, predator threats, and spatially extended arenas. We use this environment\
  \ as a platform for applying joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing\
  \ detailed, quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and\
  \ planning. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL\
  \ agents can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent\
  \ dynamics -- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results\
  \ show that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with neuroethology-inspired\
  \ tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural dynamics -- uncovers rich\
  \ structure in their learning dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible. We\
  \ distill these tools into a general analysis framework linking core behavioral\
  \ and representational features to diagnostic methods, which can be reused for a\
  \ wide range of tasks and agents. As agents grow more complex and autonomous, bridging\
  \ neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI will be essential -- not just for understanding\
  \ their behavior, but for ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors\
  \ that are hard to measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on\
  \ lessons from how biological intelligence is studied."
