title: 'uPVC-Net: A Universal Premature Ventricular Contraction Detection Deep Learning
  Algorithm'
description: "arXiv:2506.11238v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Introduction: Premature\
  \ Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac arrhythmias originating from\
  \ the ventricles. Accurate detection remains challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram\
  \ (ECG) waveforms caused by differences in lead placement, recording conditions,\
  \ and population demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep\
  \ learning model to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is\
  \ developed on four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats\
  \ collected from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs\
  \ a custom architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each\
  \ experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.\
  \ Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets.\
  \ Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%.\
  \ Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations\
  \ and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment."
