title: 'DISCO: Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning with Conditional Distance Correlation'
description: "arXiv:2506.11653v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: During prediction\
  \ tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up with the final answer\
  \ - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When predicting objects from\
  \ images, for example, the lighting conditions could be correlated to different\
  \ targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model might use these signals\
  \ as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A predictor that uses lighting\
  \ conditions instead of real object-specific details is obviously undesirable. To\
  \ address this challenge, we introduce a standard anti-causal prediction model (SAM)\
  \ that creates a causal framework for analyzing the information pathways influencing\
  \ our predictor in anti-causal settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying\
  \ a specific conditional independence criterion will focus solely on the direct\
  \ causal path from label to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining\
  \ variables. Finally, we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses\
  \ conditional distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression\
  \ tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias mitigation\
  \ experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical kernel-based methods."
