title: 'RAG+: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Application-Aware Reasoning'
description: "arXiv:2506.11555v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integration of\
  \ external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational\
  \ in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However,\
  \ existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge,\
  \ leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work,\
  \ we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates\
  \ application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus\
  \ consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually\
  \ or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables\
  \ LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,\
  \ goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and\
  \ medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently\
  \ outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and\
  \ peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable\
  \ application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge\
  \ integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs."

View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning.

RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes.
