title: Evolution Guided Generative Flow Networks
description: "arXiv:2402.02186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Generative\
  \ Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of probabilistic generative models that\
  \ learn to sample compositional objects proportional to their rewards. One big challenge\
  \ of GFlowNets is training them effectively when dealing with long time horizons\
  \ and sparse rewards. To address this, we propose Evolution guided generative flow\
  \ networks (EGFN), a simple but powerful augmentation to the GFlowNets training\
  \ using Evolutionary algorithms (EA). Our method can work on top of any GFlowNets\
  \ training objective, by training a set of agent parameters using EA, storing the\
  \ resulting trajectories in the prioritized replay buffer, and training the GFlowNets\
  \ agent using the stored trajectories. We present a thorough investigation over\
  \ a wide range of toy and real-world benchmark tasks showing the effectiveness of\
  \ our method in handling long trajectories and sparse rewards. We release the code\
  \ at http://github.com/zarifikram/egfn."
