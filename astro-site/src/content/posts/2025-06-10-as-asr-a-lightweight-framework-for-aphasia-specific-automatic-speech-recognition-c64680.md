title: 'AS-ASR: A Lightweight Framework for Aphasia-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition'
description: "arXiv:2506.06566v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper proposes\
  \ AS-ASR, a lightweight aphasia-specific speech recognition framework based on Whisper-tiny,\
  \ tailored for low-resource deployment on edge devices. Our approach introduces\
  \ a hybrid training strategy that systematically combines standard and aphasic speech\
  \ at varying ratios, enabling robust generalization, and a GPT-4-based reference\
  \ enhancement method that refines noisy aphasic transcripts, improving supervision\
  \ quality. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple data mixing configurations\
  \ and evaluation settings. Results show that our fine-tuned model significantly\
  \ outperforms the zero-shot baseline, reducing WER on aphasic speech by over 30%\
  \ while preserving performance on standard speech. The proposed framework offers\
  \ a scalable, efficient solution for real-world disordered speech recognition."
