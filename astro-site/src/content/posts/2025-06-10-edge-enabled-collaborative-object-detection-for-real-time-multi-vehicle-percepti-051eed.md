title: Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection for Real-Time Multi-Vehicle Perception

Traditional on-board perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots, while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in dynamic environments.
