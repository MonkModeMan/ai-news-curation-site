title: Enhancing multimodal analogical reasoning with Logic Augmented Generation
description: "arXiv:2504.11190v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent advances\
  \ in Large Language Models have demonstrated their capabilities across a variety\
  \ of tasks. However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge from natural language\
  \ remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active experience with the physical\

  \ spaces that guide the automated text generation reasoning process to achieve more\
  \ efficient and explainable results. In this paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation\
  \ (LAG) framework that leverages the explicit representation of a text through a\
  \ semantic knowledge graph and applies it in combination with prompt heuristics\
  \ to elicit implicit analogical connections. This method generates extended knowledge\
  \ graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled\
  \ multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three metaphor\
  \ detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they require deep analogical\
  \ reasoning capabilities. The results show that this integrated approach surpasses\

Title:Enhancing multimodal analogical reasoning with Logic Augmented Generation
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated their capabilities across a variety of tasks. However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge from natural language remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active experience with the physical world. Given this scenario, semantic knowledge graphs can serve as conceptual spaces that guide the automated text generation reasoning process to achieve more efficient and explainable results. In this paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the explicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and applies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical connections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled multimodal data regardless of the domain.
