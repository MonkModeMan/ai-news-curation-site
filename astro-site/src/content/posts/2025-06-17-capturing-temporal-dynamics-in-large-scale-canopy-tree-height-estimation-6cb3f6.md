title: Capturing Temporal Dynamics in Large-Scale Canopy Tree Height Estimation
description: "arXiv:2501.19328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: With the\
  \ rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, accurate large-scale tree canopy height\
  \ maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating above-ground\
  \ biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we present a novel\
  \ approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time.\
  \ Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-1\
  \ composite and Sentinel~2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as\
  \ the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal\
  \ canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part\
  \ of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing\
  \ more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal\
  \ height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring\
  \ of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses."
