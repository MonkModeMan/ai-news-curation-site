title: "Incivility and Rigidity: The Risks of Fine-Tuning LLMs for Political Argumentation"
description: "arXiv:2411.16813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support."
