title: A Proposal to Extend the Common Model of Cognition with Metacognition
description: "arXiv:2506.07807v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Common Model of\
  \ Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of the structure and processing\
  \ required by a cognitive architecture for human-like minds. We propose a unified\
  \ approach to integrating metacognition within the CMC. We propose that metacognition\
  \ involves reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities\
  \ and processes in working memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive\
  \ capabilities of the CMC, making minimal extensions in the structure and information\
  \ available within working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our\
  \ proposal."

Title:A Proposal to Extend the Common Model of Cognition with Metacognition
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of the structure and processing required by a cognitive architecture for human-like minds. We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC, making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.
