title: 'Upgrade or Switch: Do We Need a New Registry Architecture for the Internet
  of AI Agents?'
description: "arXiv:2506.12003v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The emerging Internet\
  \ of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale,\
  \ reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents\
  \ initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly\
  \ with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation,\
  \ and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities.\
  \ This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built\
  \ registry architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points:\
  \ DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation\
  \ unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate\
  \ for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)\
  \ Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband\
  \ transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental,\
  \ changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate\
  \ solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis\
  \ suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized registries for critical\
  \ agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases."
