title: 'SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional Autonomous
  Agent Systems'
description: "arXiv:2506.07564v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in\
  \ large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful\
  \ autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite\
  \ their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled\
  \ mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination.\
  \ In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building\
  \ trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow\
  \ control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of\
  \ all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining\
  \ LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or\
  \ adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness\
  \ in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution,\
  \ conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global\
  \ consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead\
  \ logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against\
  \ runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH,\
  \ a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial,\
  \ noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate\
  \ that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security\
  \ guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art.\
  \ Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust,\
  \ and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy."
