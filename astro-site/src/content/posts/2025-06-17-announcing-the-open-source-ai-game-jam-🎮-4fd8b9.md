Announcing the Open Source AI Game Jam ðŸŽ®
Unleash Your Creativity with AI Tools and make a game in a weekend!
We're thrilled to announce the first ever Open Source AI Game Jam, where you will create a game using AI tools.
With AI's potential to enhance game experiences and workflows, we're excited to see what you can accomplish: incorporate generative AI tools like Stable Diffusion into your game or workflow to unlock new features and accelerate your development process.
From texture generation to lifelike NPCs and realistic text-to-speech, the options are endless.
ðŸ“† Mark your calendars: the game jam will take place from Friday to Sunday, July 7-9.

Why Are We Organizing This?
In a time when some popular game jams restrict the use of AI tools, we believe it's crucial to provide a platform specifically dedicated to showcasing the incredible possibilities AI offers game developers. Especially when those tools are open, transparent, and accessible.
We want to see these jams thrive and empower indie developers with the tools they need to boost productivity and unlock their full potential.
What Are AI Tools?
AI tools, particularly generative ones like Stable Diffusion, open up a whole new world of possibilities in game development.
From accelerated workflows to in-game features, you can harness the power of AI for texture generation, lifelike AI non-player characters (NPCs), and realistic text-to-speech functionality.

Everyone is welcome to join the Open Source AI Game Jam, regardless of skill level or location. You can participate alone or in a team of any size.

We'll provide more details to guide you along the way.
Can I Use Existing Assets?
Absolutely! You're welcome to use existing assets, code, or AI tools that you have legal access to.
We want to ensure fairness and give you the freedom to leverage the resources at your disposal.
Is There a Theme?

How Will the Games Be Judged?
Participants will rate other games based on three criteria: fun, creativity, and theme. The judges will showcase and choose the winner from the Top 10.
