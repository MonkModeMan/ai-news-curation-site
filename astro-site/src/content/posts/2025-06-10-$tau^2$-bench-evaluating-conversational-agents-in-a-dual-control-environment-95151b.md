title: '$\tau^2$-Bench: Evaluating Conversational Agents in a Dual-Control Environment'
description: "arXiv:2506.07982v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Existing benchmarks\
  \ for conversational AI agents simulate single-control environments, where only\
  \ the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world, while the user remains\
  \ a passive information provider. This differs from real-world scenarios like technical\
  \ support, where users need to actively participate in modifying the state of the\
  \ (shared) world. In order to address this gap, we introduce $\\tau^2$-bench, with\
  \ four key contributions:\n  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a\
  \ Dec-POMDP, where both agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic\
  \ environment that tests both agent coordination and communication,\n  2) A compositional\
  \ task generator that programmatically creates diverse, verifiable tasks from atomic\
  \ components, ensuring domain coverage and controlled complexity,\n  3) A reliable\
  \ user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose behavior is constrained\
  \ by tools and observable states, improving simulation fidelity,\n  4) Fine-grained\
  \ analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations including separating\
  \ errors arising from reasoning vs communication/coordination.\n  In particular,\
  \ our experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user\
  \ to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding users. Overall, $\\tau^2$-bench\
  \ provides a controlled testbed for agents that must both reason effectively and\
  \ guide user actions."
