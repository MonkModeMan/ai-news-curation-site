title: Epistemic Artificial Intelligence is Essential for Machine Learning Models
  to Truly `Know When They Do Not Know'
description: "arXiv:2505.04950v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Despite AI's impressive\
  \ achievements, including recent advances in generative and large language models,\
  \ there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI systems to handle uncertainty\
  \ and generalize beyond their training data. AI models consistently fail to make\
  \ robust enough predictions when facing unfamiliar or adversarial data. Traditional\
  \ machine learning approaches struggle to address this issue, due to an overemphasis\
  \ on data fitting, while current uncertainty quantification approaches suffer from\
  \ serious limitations. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic\
  \ artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn from what they\
  \ know while at the same time acknowledging their ignorance, using the mathematics\
  \ of second-order uncertainty measures. This approach, which leverages the expressive\
  \ power of such measures to efficiently manage uncertainty, offers an effective\
  \ way to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, allowing them to better\
  \ handle unpredictable real-world environments."
