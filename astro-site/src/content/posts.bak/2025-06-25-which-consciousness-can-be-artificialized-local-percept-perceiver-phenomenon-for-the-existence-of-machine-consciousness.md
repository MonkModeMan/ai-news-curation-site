title: "Which Consciousness Can Be Artificialized? Local Percept-Perceiver Phenomenon for the Existence of Machine Consciousness"
description: "arXiv:2506.18935v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm of the local percept-perceiver phenomenon to formalize certain observations in neuroscientific theories of consciousness. Using this model, a set-theoretic formalism is developed for artificial systems, and the existence of machine consciousness is proved by invoking Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The article argues for the possibility of a reductionist form of epistemic consciousness within machines."
