title: "Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies"
description: "arXiv:2505.14544v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges."
