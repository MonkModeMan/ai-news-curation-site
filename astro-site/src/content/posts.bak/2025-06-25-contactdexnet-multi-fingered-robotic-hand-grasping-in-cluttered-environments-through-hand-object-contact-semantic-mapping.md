title: "ContactDexNet: Multi-fingered Robotic Hand Grasping in Cluttered Environments through Hand-object Contact Semantic Mapping"
description: "arXiv:2404.08844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The deep learning models has significantly advanced dexterous manipulation techniques for multi-fingered hand grasping. However, the contact information-guided grasping in cluttered environments remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we have developed a method for generating multi-fingered hand grasp samples in cluttered settings through contact semantic map. We introduce a contact semantic conditional variational autoencoder network (CoSe-CVAE) for creating comprehensive contact semantic map from object point cloud. We utilize grasp detection method to estimate hand grasp poses from the contact semantic map. Finally, an unified grasp evaluation model PointNetGPD++ is designed to assess grasp quality and collision probability, substantially improving the reliability of identifying optimal grasps in cluttered scenarios. Our grasp generation method has demonstrated remarkable success, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by at least 4.65% with 81.0% average grasping success rate in real-world single-object environment and 75.3% grasping success rate in cluttered scenes. We also proposed the multi-modal multi-fingered grasping dataset generation method. Our multi-fingered hand grasping dataset outperforms previous datasets in scene diversity, modality diversity.
