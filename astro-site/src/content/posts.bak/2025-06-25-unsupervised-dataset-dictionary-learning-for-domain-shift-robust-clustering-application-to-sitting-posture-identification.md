title: "Unsupervised Dataset Dictionary Learning for domain shift robust clustering: application to sitting posture identification"
description: "arXiv:2506.19410v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach, Unsupervised Dataset Dictionary Learning (U-DaDiL), for totally unsupervised robust clustering applied to sitting posture identification. Traditional methods often lack adaptability to diverse datasets and suffer from domain shift issues. U-DaDiL addresses these challenges by aligning distributions from different datasets using Wasserstein barycenter based representation. Experimental evaluations on the Office31 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in cluster alignment accuracy. This work also presents a promising step for addressing domain shift and robust clustering for unsupervised sitting posture identification"
