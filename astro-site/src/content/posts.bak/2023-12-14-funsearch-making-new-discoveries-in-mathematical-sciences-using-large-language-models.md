title: "FunSearch: Making new discoveries in mathematical sciences using Large Language Models"
description: "In a paper published in Nature, we introduce FunSearch, a method for searching for “functions” written in computer code, and find new solutions in mathematics and computer science. FunSearch works by pairing a pre-trained LLM, whose goal is to provide creative solutions in the form of computer code, with an automated “evaluator”, which guards against hallucinations and incorrect ideas."
