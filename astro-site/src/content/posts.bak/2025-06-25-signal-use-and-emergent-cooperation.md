title: "Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation"
description: "arXiv:2506.18920v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes, learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture - Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks."
