title: "Private Model Personalization Revisited"
description: "arXiv:2506.19220v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an unknown embedding $U^* inmathbb{R}^{dtimes k}$ that maps the user parameters in $mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $mathbb{R}^k$, where $kll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike [CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions). Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term in [JRS+21] by a factor of $widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin loss."
