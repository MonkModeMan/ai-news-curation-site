title: "Citizenship Challenges in Artificial Intelligence Education"
description: "arXiv:2506.18955v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This chapter addresses the citizenship challenges related to AI in education, particularly concerning students, teachers, and other educational stakeholders in the context of AI integration. We first explore how to foster AI awareness and education, along with various strategies to promote a socio-critical approach to AI training, aiming to identify relevant and ethical uses to prioritise. In the second part, we discuss critical thinking and computational thinking skills that can be mobilised within certain AI-supported educational activities, depending on the degree of creative and transformative engagement those activities require."
