Title:An Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism for Cloud AI Systems via Integration of Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase, the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.
