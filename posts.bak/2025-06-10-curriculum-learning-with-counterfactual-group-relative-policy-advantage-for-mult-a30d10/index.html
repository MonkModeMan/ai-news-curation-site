Title:Curriculum Learning With Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage For Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA), which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit signals that reflect each agent&#39;s impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent&#39;s contribution through constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.
